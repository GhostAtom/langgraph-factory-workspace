   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Update the deployment pipeline to accommodate the new naming convention.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Implement monitoring to track branch naming compliance.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Create a branch with a valid name - Expected: Branch is created successfully.
- **Test Case 2**: Create a branch with an invalid name - Expected: Branch creation is rejected.
- **Test Case 3**: Rename an existing branch to a valid name - Expected: Branch is renamed successfully.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Branch naming convention is documented and accessible to all team members.
- [ ] All branches in the repository comply with the new naming convention.
- [ ] CI/CD processes are unaffected by the new naming convention.
- [ ] Team members are trained on the new branch naming policy.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Git, CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions)
- **Performance**: No significant impact on repository performance.
- **Security**: Ensure branch naming does not expose sensitive information.
- **Scalability**: Naming convention should support future growth and additional branches.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Resistance to change from team members - Mitigation: Conduct training sessions and provide documentation.
- **Medium Risk**: CI/CD pipeline failures due to naming changes - Mitigation: Thorough testing and rollback plan.
- **Low Risk**: Minor disruptions during branch renaming - Mitigation: Schedule renaming during low activity periods.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 week - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 weeks - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 week - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 week - Deployment

This plan provides a structured approach to implementing and testing a new branch naming convention, ensuring a smooth transition and minimal disruption to ongoing development activities.

This plan provides a structured approach to implementing and testing a new branch naming convention, ensuring a smooth transition and minimal disruption to ongoing development activities.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the project plan for testing a new branch naming convention in the Codex repository, we will follow a structured approach. Here's a detailed step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Ensure you have access to the Codex repository with the necessary permissions.
   - Verify that all team members have the required access levels.

2. **Development Environment Configuration**
   - Set up local development environments for testing the branch naming convention.
   - Ensure Git is installed and configured on all development machines.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Identify and install any necessary tools or libraries for branch management.
   - Ensure CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) are configured to support the new naming convention.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Define Branch Naming Convention**
   - Establish a clear and concise naming convention. For example, use prefixes like `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`, `release/`, etc.
   - Document the naming convention and share it with the team.

2. **Implement Branch Naming Policy**
   - Integrate the naming convention into the repository settings or CI/CD pipeline.
   - Use Git hooks or CI/CD scripts to enforce the naming convention during branch creation.

3. **Update Existing Branches**
   - Identify all existing branches that do not comply with the new convention.
   - Rename these branches to align with the new naming policy.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests to validate branch names against the new convention.
   - Ensure tests cover both valid and invalid branch names.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test the naming convention with existing CI/CD processes to ensure compatibility.
   - Verify that the CI/CD pipeline triggers correctly with the new branch names.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a peer review of the implementation and test cases.
   - Address any feedback or issues identified during the review.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process Verification**
   - Ensure the build process recognizes and works with the new branch names.
   - Test the build process with branches named according to the new convention.

2. **Deployment Pipeline Update**
   - Update the deployment pipeline to accommodate the new naming convention.
   - Test the deployment process to ensure it functions correctly with the new branch names.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement monitoring to track compliance with the branch naming convention.
   - Set up alerts for any branches that do not comply with the naming policy.

### Additional Steps

- **Documentation**
  - Update the project documentation to include the new branch naming convention.
  - Ensure the documentation is accessible to all team members.

- **Training**
  - Conduct training sessions for team members to familiarize them with the new branch naming policy.
  - Provide resources and support to address any questions or concerns.

- **Risk Mitigation**
  - Prepare a rollback plan in case of any issues with the new naming convention.
  - Schedule branch renaming and other disruptive activities during low activity periods to minimize impact.

By following this implementation strategy, we can ensure a smooth transition to the new branch naming convention, improving consistency and collaboration within the development team.
