        # Project Plan: Create a Python Hello World Script with Tests

## Overview
The objective of this project is to create a simple Python script that outputs "Hello, World!" to the console. Additionally, we will write tests to ensure the script functions correctly. This project serves as an introductory exercise in Python development, testing, and deployment.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Initialize a new Git repository and create a README file.
   - [ ] Development environment: Ensure Python is installed and set up a virtual environment.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Install any necessary testing frameworks (e.g., pytest).

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Create a Python script that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
   - [ ] Add a function within the script to encapsulate the print statement for easier testing.
   - [ ] Ensure the script can be executed from the command line.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests to verify the output of the function.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Ensure the script runs correctly as a standalone program.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a peer review to ensure code quality and adherence to best practices.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Create a simple build script if necessary.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline to automate testing.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Not applicable for this simple script.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Verify the function returns "Hello, World!" - Expected: "Hello, World!"
- **Test Case 2**: Ensure the script runs without errors from the command line - Expected: No errors
- **Test Case 3**: Check that the script outputs to the console correctly - Expected: Console output "Hello, World!"

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The script outputs "Hello, World!" when executed.
- [ ] All tests pass successfully.
- [ ] Code is reviewed and approved by a peer.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to include instructions on running the script and tests.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Python 3.x, pytest
- **Performance**: The script should execute in under 1 second.
- **Security**: No sensitive data is handled; standard security practices apply.
- **Scalability**: Not applicable for this simple script.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: None identified for this simple task.
- **Medium Risk**: Potential issues with environment setup; mitigate by providing clear setup instructions.
- **Low Risk**: Minor syntax errors; mitigate through testing and code review.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 day - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 1 day - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 day - Testing & Quality

This plan outlines the steps necessary to create a simple Python "Hello, World!" script with accompanying tests, ensuring a smooth development process and high-quality output.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the "Hello, World!" Python script with tests, we'll follow the outlined plan and break it down into detailed steps. Here's a step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Initialize a new Git repository.
   - Create a `README.md` file with a brief description of the project.

2. **Development Environment**
   - Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
   - Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
     ```

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Install `pytest` for testing:
     ```bash
     pip install pytest
     ```

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Create the Python Script**
   - Create a file named `hello_world.py`.
   - Implement a function that returns "Hello, World!" and a main block to print it:
     ```python
     def get_greeting():
         return "Hello, World!"

     if __name__ == "__main__":
         print(get_greeting())
     ```

2. **Ensure Script Execution**
   - Make sure the script can be executed from the command line:
     ```bash
     python hello_world.py
     ```

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Create a `tests` directory and a test file `test_hello_world.py`.
   - Write a unit test to verify the function's output:
     ```python
     from hello_world import get_greeting

     def test_get_greeting():
         assert get_greeting() == "Hello, World!"
     ```

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Write a test to ensure the script runs correctly as a standalone program. This can be done using subprocess to capture the output:
     ```python
     import subprocess

     def test_script_output():
         result = subprocess.run(['python', 'hello_world.py'], capture_output=True, text=True)
         assert result.stdout.strip() == "Hello, World!"
     ```

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a peer review to ensure code quality and adherence to best practices.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - For this simple script, a build script is not necessary. Ensure the script and tests are in the repository.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or another CI tool to automate testing on each commit.

3. **Documentation**
   - Update the `README.md` with instructions on how to run the script and tests:
     ```markdown
     ## Running the Script
     To execute the script, run:
     ```
     python hello_world.py
     ```

     ## Running Tests
     To run the tests, use:
     ```
     pytest
     ```

### Final Steps

- **Testing**
  - Run all tests to ensure they pass:
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

- **Commit Changes**
  - Commit the code with a descriptive message:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Implement Hello World script with tests"
    ```

- **Push to Repository**
  - Push the changes to the remote repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

By following these steps, you will have a fully functional "Hello, World!" Python script with tests, ready for review and deployment.
