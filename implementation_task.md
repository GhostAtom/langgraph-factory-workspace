        # Project Plan: Add a Simple /status Endpoint that Returns System Uptime

## Overview
The goal of this project is to implement a new `/status` endpoint in the existing application. This endpoint will return the system's uptime, providing a simple way to monitor the application's availability and performance.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the repository is up-to-date and branch is created for the feature.
   - [ ] Development environment: Confirm the development environment is configured correctly.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Verify all necessary dependencies are installed.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Implement `/status` endpoint: Create a new endpoint that calculates and returns the system uptime.
   - [ ] Integrate uptime calculation: Use system libraries or tools to accurately calculate uptime.
   - [ ] Format response: Ensure the response is in a readable and consistent format (e.g., JSON).

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests to verify the uptime calculation and endpoint response.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Ensure the endpoint integrates correctly with the existing system.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a thorough review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Update the build process to include the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Ensure the deployment pipeline is configured to deploy the changes.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Implement monitoring for the new endpoint to track its usage and performance.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Request to `/status` endpoint - Expected: Returns uptime in seconds.
- **Test Case 2**: System uptime calculation - Expected: Correctly calculates uptime from system start.
- **Test Case 3**: Response format - Expected: Returns a JSON object with uptime information.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The `/status` endpoint is accessible and returns the system uptime.
- [ ] The uptime is calculated accurately and reflects the system's actual uptime.
- [ ] The response is formatted as a JSON object with a key for uptime.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express.js (or relevant framework)
- **Performance**: Endpoint should respond within 100ms under normal load.
- **Security**: Ensure the endpoint does not expose sensitive information.
- **Scalability**: Endpoint should handle concurrent requests efficiently.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Incorrect uptime calculation - Mitigation: Use reliable system libraries for uptime.
- **Medium Risk**: Endpoint performance issues - Mitigation: Optimize code and test under load.
- **Low Risk**: Deployment issues - Mitigation: Test deployment in a staging environment first.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 day - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 days - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 day - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 day - Deployment

This plan provides a structured approach to implementing the `/status` endpoint, ensuring that all aspects of development, testing, and deployment are covered.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the `/status` endpoint that returns the system uptime, we will follow a structured approach based on the provided plan. Here's a detailed step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Ensure the repository is up-to-date by pulling the latest changes from the main branch.
   - Create a new feature branch for the `/status` endpoint implementation, e.g., `feature/status-endpoint`.

2. **Development Environment**
   - Verify that the development environment is correctly configured with Node.js and Express.js.
   - Ensure that the application is running locally without issues.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Check if any additional dependencies are required for uptime calculation. Typically, Node.js provides built-in modules for this purpose, so no extra dependencies might be needed.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Implement `/status` Endpoint**
   - Create a new route in the Express.js application for the `/status` endpoint.
   - Use Node.js's `os` module to calculate the system uptime.

2. **Integrate Uptime Calculation**
   - Use `os.uptime()` to get the system uptime in seconds.
   - Ensure the uptime is calculated accurately and reflects the system's actual uptime.

3. **Format Response**
   - Format the response as a JSON object with a key for uptime, e.g., `{ "uptime": <uptime_in_seconds> }`.
   - Ensure the response is consistent and readable.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests to verify the uptime calculation using a testing framework like Mocha or Jest.
   - Test the `/status` endpoint to ensure it returns the correct uptime.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Ensure the endpoint integrates correctly with the existing system by testing it in conjunction with other endpoints.
   - Use tools like Postman or automated scripts to test the endpoint's response.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a thorough code review to ensure code quality, adherence to standards, and proper error handling.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Update the build process to include the new endpoint.
   - Ensure that any build scripts or configurations are updated accordingly.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Configure the deployment pipeline to deploy the changes to a staging environment first.
   - Test the deployment in staging to ensure everything works as expected.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement monitoring for the new endpoint to track its usage and performance.
   - Use tools like New Relic or Datadog to monitor the endpoint's response times and error rates.

### Test Cases

- **Test Case 1**: Request to `/status` endpoint - Verify that it returns uptime in seconds.
- **Test Case 2**: System uptime calculation - Ensure it correctly calculates uptime from system start.
- **Test Case 3**: Response format - Check that it returns a JSON object with uptime information.

### Acceptance Criteria

- The `/status` endpoint is accessible and returns the system uptime.
- The uptime is calculated accurately and reflects the system's actual uptime.
- The response is formatted as a JSON object with a key for uptime.

### Technical Considerations

- Ensure the endpoint responds within 100ms under normal load.
- Verify that the endpoint does not expose sensitive information.
- Test the endpoint's scalability to handle concurrent requests efficiently.

By following this strategy, we can ensure a successful implementation of the `/status` endpoint, meeting all the acceptance criteria and technical requirements.
