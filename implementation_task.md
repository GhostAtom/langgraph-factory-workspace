        # Project Plan: Add a Simple Test Endpoint

## Overview
The objective of this project is to add a simple test endpoint to the existing application. This endpoint will be used to verify the basic functionality and connectivity of the application. It should return a static message indicating that the application is running correctly.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the repository is up-to-date and branch is created for the task.
   - [ ] Development environment: Confirm that the development environment is configured correctly.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Verify that all necessary dependencies are installed.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Create a new endpoint in the application.
   - [ ] Implement logic to return a static message, e.g., "Application is running".
   - [ ] Ensure the endpoint is accessible and correctly integrated into the application.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests to verify the endpoint returns the correct message.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Ensure the endpoint works within the context of the application.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a peer review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Ensure the application builds successfully with the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Update the deployment pipeline to include the new changes.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Implement monitoring to track the endpoint's availability and performance.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Access the test endpoint - Expected: Returns "Application is running".
- **Test Case 2**: Access the test endpoint with incorrect method - Expected: Returns method not allowed error.
- **Test Case 3**: Access the test endpoint with invalid parameters - Expected: Returns bad request error.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The endpoint returns a static message indicating the application is running.
- [ ] The endpoint is accessible via the correct URL and method.
- [ ] All tests pass successfully.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express (or relevant framework)
- **Performance**: The endpoint should respond within 200ms under normal load.
- **Security**: Ensure the endpoint is protected against unauthorized access if necessary.
- **Scalability**: The endpoint should handle a minimum of 100 concurrent requests.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: None identified.
- **Medium Risk**: Potential integration issues with existing application - Mitigation: Thorough testing and code review.
- **Low Risk**: Minor performance degradation - Mitigation: Monitor and optimize if necessary.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 day - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 days - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 day - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 day - Deployment

This plan provides a structured approach to adding a simple test endpoint, ensuring all necessary steps are taken to deliver a quality feature.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the simple test endpoint as outlined in the project plan, we will follow a structured approach. Here's a step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Ensure the repository is up-to-date by pulling the latest changes from the main branch.
   - Create a new feature branch for this task, e.g., `feature/test-endpoint`.

2. **Development Environment**
   - Verify that the development environment is correctly configured with the necessary tools and versions (Node.js, npm, etc.).
   - Ensure the application runs without errors in the current environment.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Check the `package.json` file for any missing dependencies and install them using `npm install`.
   - Confirm that all dependencies are up-to-date and compatible with the current application setup.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Create a New Endpoint**
   - Open the main application file (e.g., `app.js` or `server.js`).
   - Use Express (or the relevant framework) to define a new route for the test endpoint, e.g., `/api/test`.

2. **Implement Logic for Static Message**
   - In the route handler, implement logic to return a static message, such as "Application is running".
   - Ensure the response is in JSON format for consistency with other API responses.

3. **Integration and Accessibility**
   - Verify that the new endpoint is correctly integrated into the application.
   - Test the endpoint locally to ensure it is accessible and returns the expected message.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests for the new endpoint using a testing framework like Mocha or Jest.
   - Ensure tests cover the expected response and any edge cases.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Implement integration tests to verify the endpoint works within the context of the entire application.
   - Test scenarios include correct URL access, incorrect method access, and invalid parameters.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a peer review of the code to ensure it meets quality standards and follows best practices.
   - Address any feedback or requested changes from the review.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Ensure the application builds successfully with the new endpoint included.
   - Run any build scripts or processes required for deployment.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Update the deployment pipeline to include the changes made for the new endpoint.
   - Deploy the application to a staging environment for further testing.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement monitoring to track the availability and performance of the new endpoint.
   - Use tools like New Relic or Datadog to set up alerts for any issues.

### Test Cases

- **Test Case 1**: Access the test endpoint and verify it returns "Application is running".
- **Test Case 2**: Access the test endpoint with an incorrect method and verify it returns a method not allowed error.
- **Test Case 3**: Access the test endpoint with invalid parameters and verify it returns a bad request error.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Ensure the endpoint returns the correct static message.
- Verify the endpoint is accessible via the correct URL and method.
- Confirm all tests pass successfully.

### Final Steps

- Once all phases are complete and the acceptance criteria are met, merge the feature branch into the main branch.
- Deploy the changes to the production environment following the deployment pipeline.
- Update any relevant documentation to reflect the new endpoint.

By following this strategy, we ensure a thorough and structured implementation of the test endpoint, meeting all project requirements and quality standards.
