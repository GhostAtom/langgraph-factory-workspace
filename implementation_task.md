        # Project Plan: Add a /health Endpoint

## Overview
The task is to implement a new `/health` endpoint in the existing application. This endpoint will provide a simple health check for the application, returning a status that indicates whether the application is running correctly. This is crucial for monitoring and ensuring the application is operational.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the latest code is pulled from the main branch.
   - [ ] Development environment: Confirm the local development environment is configured correctly.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Verify all necessary dependencies are installed and up-to-date.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Define the `/health` endpoint in the application router.
   - [ ] Implement logic to check the application's health status (e.g., database connection, service availability).
   - [ ] Return a JSON response with the health status and relevant metadata (e.g., uptime, version).

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests to verify the endpoint returns the correct status under various conditions.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Ensure the endpoint works correctly within the application context.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a peer review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Update the build process to include the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Ensure the deployment pipeline is configured to deploy the changes to staging and production.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Configure monitoring tools to track the health endpoint's status and performance.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Access the `/health` endpoint when the application is running normally - Expected: Status 200 with "healthy" message.
- **Test Case 2**: Access the `/health` endpoint when the database is down - Expected: Status 500 with "unhealthy" message.
- **Test Case 3**: Access the `/health` endpoint with invalid parameters - Expected: Status 400 with "bad request" message.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The `/health` endpoint returns a 200 status code when the application is healthy.
- [ ] The endpoint provides a JSON response with application status and metadata.
- [ ] The endpoint is accessible and performs within acceptable response times.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express.js (or relevant framework), JSON
- **Performance**: The endpoint should respond within 100ms under normal load.
- **Security**: Ensure the endpoint does not expose sensitive information.
- **Scalability**: The endpoint should handle concurrent requests efficiently.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Misconfiguration of the endpoint leading to false health status - Mitigation: Thorough testing and validation.
- **Medium Risk**: Performance degradation under high load - Mitigation: Load testing and optimization.
- **Low Risk**: Minor bugs in the endpoint logic - Mitigation: Code review and unit testing.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 day - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 days - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 day - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 day - Deployment

This plan provides a structured approach to implementing the `/health` endpoint, ensuring it meets all necessary requirements and is delivered efficiently.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the `/health` endpoint as outlined in the project plan, we will follow a structured approach, breaking down the tasks into manageable steps. Here's a detailed implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Pull the latest code from the main branch using Git:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git pull origin main
     ```

2. **Development Environment**
   - Ensure your local development environment is configured correctly. This includes having Node.js and any necessary tools installed.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Verify and install all necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Define the `/health` Endpoint**
   - Open the application router file (e.g., `app.js` or `routes.js`).
   - Define a new route for the `/health` endpoint using Express.js:
     ```javascript
     app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
       // Logic to determine health status will go here
     });
     ```

2. **Implement Health Check Logic**
   - Implement logic to check the application's health status. This may include checking database connectivity and other service availabilities.
   - Example logic:
     ```javascript
     app.get('/health', async (req, res) => {
       try {
         // Check database connection
         const dbStatus = await checkDatabaseConnection();
         
         // Additional checks can be added here
         
         if (dbStatus) {
           res.status(200).json({
             status: 'healthy',
             uptime: process.uptime(),
             version: process.env.npm_package_version
           });
         } else {
           res.status(500).json({ status: 'unhealthy' });
         }
       } catch (error) {
         res.status(500).json({ status: 'unhealthy', error: error.message });
       }
     });
     ```

3. **Return JSON Response**
   - Ensure the endpoint returns a JSON response with the health status and relevant metadata such as uptime and version.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests to verify the endpoint returns the correct status under various conditions.
   - Example using a testing framework like Mocha or Jest:
     ```javascript
     describe('/health endpoint', () => {
       it('should return 200 and healthy status when application is running normally', async () => {
         const response = await request(app).get('/health');
         expect(response.status).toBe(200);
         expect(response.body.status).toBe('healthy');
       });
     });
     ```

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Ensure the endpoint works correctly within the application context by simulating real-world scenarios.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a peer review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Update the build process to include the new endpoint. Ensure any build scripts or configurations are updated.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Ensure the deployment pipeline is configured to deploy the changes to staging and production environments.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Configure monitoring tools to track the health endpoint's status and performance. This could include setting up alerts for when the endpoint returns an unhealthy status.

### Additional Steps

- **Documentation**
  - Update the application documentation to include details about the new `/health` endpoint, its purpose, and how to use it.

- **Performance Testing**
  - Conduct load testing to ensure the endpoint performs within acceptable response times under normal and high load conditions.

- **Security Review**
  - Ensure the endpoint does not expose any sensitive information and adheres to security best practices.

By following this step-by-step strategy, we can ensure the `/health` endpoint is implemented efficiently and meets all the acceptance criteria outlined in the project plan.
