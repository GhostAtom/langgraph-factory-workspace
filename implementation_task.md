     - Implement basic logging and error monitoring.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Create a new book - Expected: Book is added to the database and returned with a unique ID.
- **Test Case 2**: Retrieve a book by ID - Expected: Correct book details are returned.
- **Test Case 3**: Update a book's information - Expected: Book details are updated and returned.
- **Test Case 4**: Delete a book - Expected: Book is removed from the database.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] API responds to all CRUD operations for the "Book" entity.
- [ ] All endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes.
- [ ] API documentation is automatically generated and accessible.
- [ ] Code is clean, well-documented, and follows PEP 8 guidelines.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic, Docker, GitHub Actions
- **Performance**: API should handle at least 100 requests per second.
- **Security**: Implement basic authentication and input validation.
- **Scalability**: Design the API to be easily extendable for additional resources.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Security vulnerabilities - Mitigation: Implement input validation and authentication.
- **Medium Risk**: Performance issues under load - Mitigation: Conduct load testing and optimize code.
- **Low Risk**: Deployment failures - Mitigation: Use CI/CD for automated testing and deployment.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 week - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 weeks - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 week - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 week - Deployment

This plan provides a structured approach to developing a simple REST API with FastAPI, ensuring all aspects of software delivery are considered for successful project execution.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the project plan for creating a Simple REST API with FastAPI, we will follow a structured approach, breaking down the tasks into manageable steps. Here's a detailed implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - **Create a Git Repository**: 
     - Use GitHub to create a new repository named `fastapi-book-api`.
     - Clone the repository to your local machine.
     - Initialize the repository with a `README.md` and a `.gitignore` file (include Python-specific ignores).

2. **Development Environment**
   - **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
     - Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed on your machine.
     - Create a virtual environment using `python -m venv venv`.
     - Activate the virtual environment (`source venv/bin/activate` on macOS/Linux or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows).

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - **Install FastAPI and Uvicorn**:
     - Run `pip install fastapi uvicorn`.
   - **Install Testing Packages**:
     - Run `pip install pytest`.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Create a FastAPI Application**
   - **Initialize FastAPI App**:
     - Create a new file `main.py`.
     - Initialize a FastAPI app instance in `main.py`.

2. **Define the "Book" Model**
   - **Create a Pydantic Model**:
     - In `main.py`, define a Pydantic model for the "Book" entity with fields like `title`, `author`, and `year`.

3. **Implement CRUD Endpoints**
   - **Create Endpoint (POST /books)**:
     - Implement a POST endpoint to add a new book.
   - **Read Endpoints (GET /books and GET /books/{id})**:
     - Implement a GET endpoint to retrieve all books.
     - Implement a GET endpoint to retrieve a book by its ID.
   - **Update Endpoint (PUT /books/{id})**:
     - Implement a PUT endpoint to update a book's information.
   - **Delete Endpoint (DELETE /books/{id})**:
     - Implement a DELETE endpoint to remove a book by its ID.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - **Write Unit Tests**:
     - Create a `tests` directory.
     - Write unit tests for each endpoint using `pytest`.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - **Test API Endpoints**:
     - Use HTTPie or Postman to manually test the API endpoints.

3. **Code Review**
   - **Conduct Peer Review**:
     - Have a peer review the codebase for quality and adherence to best practices.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - **Create a Dockerfile**:
     - Write a Dockerfile to containerize the FastAPI application.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - **Set Up CI/CD with GitHub Actions**:
     - Create a GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and deployment.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - **Implement Logging and Error Monitoring**:
     - Add basic logging to the application.
     - Consider using a service like Sentry for error monitoring.

### Additional Steps

- **Documentation**:
  - Ensure API documentation is automatically generated and accessible via FastAPI's built-in documentation (Swagger UI).
  - Update the `README.md` with instructions on how to run and test the application.

- **Security**:
  - Implement basic authentication and input validation to mitigate security risks.

- **Performance Testing**:
  - Conduct load testing to ensure the API can handle at least 100 requests per second.

- **Final Review and Deployment**:
  - Ensure all acceptance criteria are met.
  - Deploy the application to a staging or production environment.

By following this step-by-step strategy, we can systematically implement the project plan, ensuring a robust and well-documented REST API with FastAPI.
