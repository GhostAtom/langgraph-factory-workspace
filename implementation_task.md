        # Project Plan: Add User Authentication

## Overview
The goal of this project is to implement OAuth2 authentication for user login. This will enhance the security of the application by allowing users to log in using a secure and standardized authentication protocol. The feature will support multiple OAuth2 providers, such as Google, Facebook, and GitHub, to offer flexibility and convenience to users.

## Definition of Done

   - [ ] Dependencies installation

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Integrate OAuth2 library into the application
   - [ ] Configure OAuth2 providers (Google, Facebook, GitHub)
   - [ ] Implement user login flow using OAuth2
   - [ ] Create user session management

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests for OAuth2 integration
   - [ ] Integration tests for login flow
   - [ ] Code review

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline
   - [ ] Monitoring setup

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: User can log in using Google OAuth2 - Expected: User is authenticated and redirected to the dashboard.
- **Test Case 2**: User can log in using Facebook OAuth2 - Expected: User is authenticated and redirected to the dashboard.
- **Test Case 3**: User session is maintained after login - Expected: User remains logged in until they log out.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can log in using Google, Facebook, and GitHub OAuth2 providers.
- [ ] User sessions are securely managed and maintained.
- [ ] The login process is seamless and user-friendly.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express, OAuth2 library (e.g., Passport.js)
- **Performance**: Authentication should not add more than 200ms to the login process.
- **Security**: Ensure secure storage of tokens and use HTTPS for all authentication requests.
- **Scalability**: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent logins.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Misconfiguration of OAuth2 providers - Mitigation: Thorough testing and validation of provider configurations.
- **Medium Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in token management - Mitigation: Regular security audits and use of secure libraries.
- **Low Risk**: User experience issues during login - Mitigation: User testing and feedback loops.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 week - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 weeks - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 week - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 week - Deployment

This plan provides a structured approach to implementing OAuth2 authentication, ensuring that all aspects of software delivery are considered and executed effectively.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the OAuth2 authentication feature as outlined in the project plan, we will follow a structured approach. Here's a detailed step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Create a new GitHub repository or clone the existing one.
   - Initialize a new Node.js project using `npm init`.
   - Set up version control with Git, ensuring a clean commit history.

2. **Development Environment**
   - Set up a local development environment with Node.js and Express.
   - Ensure that the environment is configured to use HTTPS for secure communication.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Install necessary dependencies, including Express and Passport.js for OAuth2.
   - Use `npm install express passport passport-google-oauth20 passport-facebook passport-github` to add the required libraries.

### Phase 2: Core Development

4. **Integrate OAuth2 Library into the Application**
   - Configure Passport.js in the Express application.
   - Set up middleware for initializing Passport and handling sessions.

5. **Configure OAuth2 Providers**
   - Register the application with Google, Facebook, and GitHub to obtain client IDs and secrets.
   - Configure Passport strategies for each provider using the obtained credentials.

6. **Implement User Login Flow Using OAuth2**
   - Create routes for initiating OAuth2 login and handling callbacks for each provider.
   - Implement logic to authenticate users and create sessions upon successful login.

7. **Create User Session Management**
   - Use Express sessions to manage user sessions securely.
   - Implement session serialization and deserialization with Passport.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

8. **Unit Tests for OAuth2 Integration**
   - Write unit tests to verify the configuration and functionality of each OAuth2 provider.
   - Use a testing framework like Mocha or Jest for test execution.

9. **Integration Tests for Login Flow**
   - Develop integration tests to simulate the complete login process for each provider.
   - Ensure that tests cover successful logins, failed logins, and session management.

10. **Code Review**
    - Conduct a thorough code review to ensure adherence to best practices and security standards.
    - Address any feedback or issues identified during the review process.

### Phase 4: Deployment

11. **Build Process**
    - Set up a build process using a tool like Webpack or Gulp if necessary.
    - Ensure that the application is optimized for production deployment.

12. **Deployment Pipeline**
    - Configure a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process.
    - Use a platform like Heroku, AWS, or Azure for hosting the application.

13. **Monitoring Setup**
    - Implement monitoring to track authentication performance and errors.
    - Use tools like New Relic or Datadog for real-time monitoring and alerts.

### Additional Considerations

- **Documentation**
  - Update the project documentation to include setup instructions, usage guidelines, and API references for the OAuth2 integration.

- **Security**
  - Ensure that all tokens are securely stored and transmitted.
  - Regularly audit the application for security vulnerabilities.

- **User Experience**
  - Conduct user testing to gather feedback on the login process.
  - Make necessary adjustments to improve the user experience.

By following this strategy, we can systematically implement OAuth2 authentication, ensuring that all technical and user requirements are met.
