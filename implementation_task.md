        # Project Plan: Add Health Check Endpoint

## Overview
The objective of this project is to implement a health check endpoint in the existing application. This endpoint will provide a simple way to verify that the application is running and operational. It will return a status indicating the health of the application, which can be used for monitoring and alerting purposes.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the repository is up-to-date with the latest code.
   - [ ] Development environment: Set up the local development environment.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Install any necessary dependencies for the health check implementation.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Define the health check endpoint route and method (e.g., `/health`, GET).
   - [ ] Implement the logic to check the application's health status (e.g., database connection, service availability).
   - [ ] Return a standardized response format (e.g., JSON) with status and optional details.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests to verify the health check logic.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Ensure the endpoint works correctly within the application.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a peer review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Ensure the application builds successfully with the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Update the CI/CD pipeline to include the new changes.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Configure monitoring tools to use the health check endpoint for status checks.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Health check endpoint returns status 200 when the application is healthy - Expected: HTTP 200 with a message "Healthy".
- **Test Case 2**: Health check endpoint returns status 500 when the application is not healthy - Expected: HTTP 500 with a message "Unhealthy".
- **Test Case 3**: Health check endpoint returns additional details when a specific service is down - Expected: HTTP 500 with a message "Database connection failed".

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The health check endpoint is accessible and returns the correct status.
- [ ] The endpoint provides a clear indication of the application's health.
- [ ] The endpoint is documented and included in the API documentation.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express (or relevant framework), Monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)
- **Performance**: The health check should respond within 100ms under normal conditions.
- **Security**: Ensure the endpoint is protected from unauthorized access if necessary.
- **Scalability**: The endpoint should handle multiple requests without performance degradation.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Misconfiguration of the health check logic leading to false positives/negatives - Mitigation: Thorough testing and validation.
- **Medium Risk**: Security vulnerabilities if the endpoint exposes sensitive information - Mitigation: Implement access controls and sanitize responses.
- **Low Risk**: Minor performance impact due to additional endpoint - Mitigation: Optimize the health check logic for efficiency.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 week - Setup & Preparation, Core Development
- **Phase 2**: 1 week - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 3**: 1 week - Deployment, Monitoring setup

This plan provides a structured approach to implementing a health check endpoint, ensuring that all necessary steps are taken to deliver a robust and reliable feature.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the health check endpoint as outlined in the project plan, we will follow a structured approach. Here's a step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Pull the latest changes from the main branch to ensure the local repository is up-to-date.
   - Create a new feature branch for the health check implementation.

2. **Development Environment**
   - Ensure the local development environment is set up with Node.js and any necessary tools.
   - Verify that the application runs correctly in the local environment.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Review the current dependencies to determine if any additional packages are needed for the health check (e.g., monitoring libraries).
   - Install any necessary dependencies using npm or yarn.

### Phase 2: Core Development

4. **Define the Health Check Endpoint**
   - In the Express application, define a new route for the health check endpoint, e.g., `/health`.
   - Use the GET method for this endpoint.

5. **Implement Health Check Logic**
   - Create a function to check the application's health status. This should include:
     - Checking the database connection.
     - Verifying the availability of critical services.
   - Ensure the function returns a standardized JSON response with a status and optional details.

6. **Return Standardized Response**
   - Implement logic to return HTTP 200 with a message "Healthy" if all checks pass.
   - Return HTTP 500 with a message "Unhealthy" and details if any check fails.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

7. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests for the health check logic to ensure it correctly identifies healthy and unhealthy states.
   - Use a testing framework like Mocha or Jest.

8. **Integration Tests**
   - Write integration tests to verify the endpoint works correctly within the application.
   - Test the endpoint's response under different scenarios (e.g., database down).

9. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a peer review of the implemented code to ensure quality and adherence to coding standards.

### Phase 4: Deployment

10. **Build Process**
    - Ensure the application builds successfully with the new endpoint.
    - Run any build scripts or processes required for deployment.

11. **Deployment Pipeline**
    - Update the CI/CD pipeline to include the new changes.
    - Deploy the application to a staging environment for further testing.

12. **Monitoring Setup**
    - Configure monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to use the health check endpoint for status checks.
    - Set up alerts for any unhealthy status responses.

### Phase 5: Documentation & Finalization

13. **Documentation**
    - Update the API documentation to include the new health check endpoint.
    - Document the expected responses and any configuration options.

14. **Final Testing**
    - Perform final testing in the staging environment to ensure everything works as expected.
    - Validate that the endpoint meets all acceptance criteria.

15. **Deployment to Production**
    - Once all tests pass and the code is approved, deploy the application to the production environment.

16. **Post-Deployment Monitoring**
    - Monitor the application to ensure the health check endpoint is functioning correctly in production.

By following this strategy, we ensure a comprehensive implementation of the health check endpoint, covering all aspects from development to deployment and monitoring.
