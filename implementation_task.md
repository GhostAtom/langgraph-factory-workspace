        # Project Plan: Create Azure Resource Group for MVP

## Overview
The objective of this project is to create an Azure Resource Group to support the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) deployment. This resource group will serve as the foundational infrastructure for hosting and managing all necessary Azure resources required for the MVP.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts
   - [ ] Development environment configured with Azure CLI and necessary tools
   - [ ] Dependencies installation, including Terraform or ARM templates

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Define the Azure Resource Group configuration
   - [ ] Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts for resource group creation
   - [ ] Configure access permissions and policies for the resource group

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests for IaC scripts
   - [ ] Integration tests to ensure resource group creation and configuration
   - [ ] Code review to ensure best practices and compliance

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process for IaC scripts
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline setup for automated resource group creation
   - [ ] Monitoring setup to track resource group health and usage

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Validate resource group creation - Expected: Resource group is created successfully in the specified Azure region.
- **Test Case 2**: Verify access permissions - Expected: Only authorized users can access and manage the resource group.
- **Test Case 3**: Check resource group policies - Expected: Policies are correctly applied and enforced within the resource group.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Resource group is created in the specified Azure region
- [ ] Access permissions are correctly configured
- [ ] Policies are applied and enforced within the resource group

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Azure, Azure CLI, Terraform/ARM templates
- **Performance**: Resource group creation should be completed within 5 minutes
- **Security**: Ensure that access permissions are restricted to authorized personnel only
- **Scalability**: Resource group should support scaling of resources as needed for MVP

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Misconfiguration of access permissions - Mitigation: Implement strict access control policies and conduct thorough testing.
- **Medium Risk**: Delays in resource group creation due to Azure service issues - Mitigation: Monitor Azure service status and have contingency plans.
- **Low Risk**: Minor errors in IaC scripts - Mitigation: Conduct code reviews and testing to catch errors early.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 week - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 weeks - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 week - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 week - Deployment

This plan provides a structured approach to creating an Azure Resource Group for the MVP, ensuring that all necessary steps are taken to deliver a secure and scalable infrastructure.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the project plan for creating an Azure Resource Group for the MVP, we will follow a structured approach, breaking down the tasks into manageable steps. Here's a detailed implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Scripts**
   - Create a new GitHub repository for the project.
   - Initialize the repository with a README file and a `.gitignore` file suitable for Terraform or ARM templates.
   - Set up branch protection rules to ensure code quality.

2. **Development Environment Configuration**
   - Install Azure CLI on your local machine or development environment.
   - Install Terraform or configure your environment for ARM templates, depending on the chosen IaC tool.
   - Verify the installation by running basic Azure CLI and Terraform/ARM commands.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - If using Terraform, ensure that the correct version is installed and configured.
   - Install any additional tools or plugins required for Azure resource management.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Define the Azure Resource Group Configuration**
   - Determine the Azure region where the resource group will be created.
   - Define naming conventions and tags for the resource group.

2. **Implement IaC Scripts for Resource Group Creation**
   - Create a Terraform configuration file (e.g., `main.tf`) or ARM template to define the resource group.
   - Specify the resource group name, location, and any tags or metadata.

3. **Configure Access Permissions and Policies**
   - Define role-based access control (RBAC) policies in the IaC scripts.
   - Ensure that only authorized users or service principals have access to the resource group.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests for IaC Scripts**
   - Write unit tests to validate the syntax and logic of the IaC scripts.
   - Use tools like `terraform validate` or ARM template validation commands.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Deploy the resource group in a test environment to ensure it is created correctly.
   - Verify that all configurations, permissions, and policies are applied as expected.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a thorough code review with peers to ensure adherence to best practices.
   - Address any feedback or issues identified during the review.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process for IaC Scripts**
   - Set up a build process using a CI/CD tool like GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, or Jenkins.
   - Ensure the build process includes validation and testing steps.

2. **Deployment Pipeline Setup**
   - Create a deployment pipeline to automate the creation of the resource group in Azure.
   - Configure the pipeline to trigger on specific events, such as merges to the main branch.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement monitoring tools to track the health and usage of the resource group.
   - Set up alerts for any anomalies or issues with the resource group.

### Testing and Validation

- **Test Case 1**: Deploy the resource group and verify its creation in the specified Azure region.
- **Test Case 2**: Test access permissions by attempting to access the resource group with authorized and unauthorized users.
- **Test Case 3**: Validate that policies are correctly applied and enforced within the resource group.

### Documentation

- Update the project documentation to include setup instructions, usage guidelines, and any relevant architectural decisions.

### Final Steps

- Ensure all acceptance criteria are met.
- Conduct a final review and approval process.
- Deploy the resource group to the staging/production environment.

By following this step-by-step strategy, we can ensure a successful implementation of the Azure Resource Group for the MVP, meeting all technical and business requirements.
