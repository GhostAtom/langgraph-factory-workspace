        # Project Plan: Add a /health Endpoint

## Overview
The task involves adding a new `/health` endpoint to the existing application. This endpoint will provide a simple health check mechanism to ensure that the application is running correctly. It will return a status indicating the health of the application, which can be used by monitoring tools to track the application's availability and performance.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the repository is up-to-date and branch is created for the feature.
   - [ ] Development environment: Confirm the development environment is configured correctly.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Install any new dependencies required for the health check endpoint.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Define the endpoint: Create a new route `/health` in the application.
   - [ ] Implement logic: Develop the logic to check the application's health status (e.g., database connection, service availability).
   - [ ] Response format: Ensure the endpoint returns a JSON response with a status message and HTTP status code.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write unit tests to cover the new endpoint functionality.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Develop integration tests to ensure the endpoint works within the application context.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a code review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Update the build process to include the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Ensure the deployment pipeline is configured to deploy the changes to staging and production.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Configure monitoring tools to use the `/health` endpoint for health checks.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Access the `/health` endpoint when the application is running - Expected: HTTP 200 with status "healthy".
- **Test Case 2**: Access the `/health` endpoint when the database is down - Expected: HTTP 503 with status "unhealthy".
- **Test Case 3**: Access the `/health` endpoint with invalid HTTP method - Expected: HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The `/health` endpoint returns a 200 status code when the application is healthy.
- [ ] The `/health` endpoint returns a 503 status code when the application is unhealthy.
- [ ] The endpoint is documented in the API documentation.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express (or relevant framework), any monitoring tools.
- **Performance**: The endpoint should respond within 100ms under normal load.
- **Security**: Ensure the endpoint does not expose sensitive information.
- **Scalability**: The endpoint should handle concurrent requests efficiently.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Misconfiguration of monitoring tools - Mitigation: Thoroughly test the monitoring setup in staging.
- **Medium Risk**: Endpoint performance issues under load - Mitigation: Conduct load testing.
- **Low Risk**: Minor bugs in endpoint logic - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing and code review.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 day - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 days - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 day - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 day - Deployment

This plan provides a structured approach to implementing the `/health` endpoint, ensuring that all aspects of development, testing, and deployment are covered.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the `/health` endpoint according to the provided plan, we will follow a structured approach, breaking down the tasks into manageable steps. Here's a detailed implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Ensure the repository is up-to-date by pulling the latest changes from the main branch.
   - Create a new feature branch for the `/health` endpoint implementation:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/add-health-endpoint
     ```

2. **Development Environment**
   - Verify that the development environment is correctly configured with Node.js and Express.
   - Ensure that all existing tests pass to confirm a stable starting point.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Review the current dependencies to determine if any new packages are needed for health checks (e.g., for database connectivity).
   - Install any necessary packages using npm or yarn.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Define the Endpoint**
   - In your Express application, add a new route for `/health` in the appropriate router file (e.g., `routes/health.js`).

2. **Implement Logic**
   - Develop the logic to check the application's health status. This may include:
     - Checking database connectivity.
     - Verifying service availability.
   - Example code snippet:
     ```javascript
     const express = require('express');
     const router = express.Router();

     router.get('/health', async (req, res) => {
       try {
         // Example: Check database connection
         const dbStatus = await checkDatabaseConnection();
         if (!dbStatus) {
           return res.status(503).json({ status: 'unhealthy' });
         }
         // Add other health checks as needed
         res.status(200).json({ status: 'healthy' });
       } catch (error) {
         res.status(503).json({ status: 'unhealthy', error: error.message });
       }
     });

     module.exports = router;
     ```

3. **Response Format**
   - Ensure the endpoint returns a JSON response with a status message and appropriate HTTP status code.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests for the `/health` endpoint using a testing framework like Mocha or Jest.
   - Example test case:
     ```javascript
     const request = require('supertest');
     const app = require('../app'); // Assuming app is your Express instance

     describe('GET /health', () => {
       it('should return 200 and healthy status', async () => {
         const res = await request(app).get('/health');
         expect(res.statusCode).toEqual(200);
         expect(res.body.status).toEqual('healthy');
       });
     });
     ```

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Develop integration tests to ensure the endpoint works within the application context.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a code review with peers to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Update the build process if necessary to include the new endpoint.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Ensure the deployment pipeline is configured to deploy the changes to staging and production environments.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Configure monitoring tools to use the `/health` endpoint for health checks.

### Documentation

- Update the API documentation to include details about the `/health` endpoint, its purpose, and response format.

### Testing

- Conduct load testing to ensure the endpoint performs well under normal and high load conditions.

### Final Steps

- Commit the changes with a descriptive message:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add /health endpoint for application health checks"
  git push origin feature/add-health-endpoint
  ```

- Create a pull request for review and merge into the main branch once approved.

By following this strategy, we ensure a comprehensive implementation of the `/health` endpoint, covering all aspects from development to deployment.
