        # Project Plan: Feature: Create a Home Page

## Overview
The task is to design and implement a new home page for our web application. This page will serve as the main entry point for users, providing them with an overview of the site's offerings, navigation to key sections, and a welcoming user experience. The home page should be responsive, visually appealing, and optimized for performance.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Create a new branch for the home page feature.
   - [ ] Development environment: Ensure all team members have the necessary tools and access.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Install any new libraries or frameworks needed for the home page.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Design mockups: Collaborate with the design team to create wireframes and mockups.
   - [ ] HTML/CSS structure: Develop the basic structure and styling of the home page.
   - [ ] JavaScript functionality: Implement interactive elements such as sliders, modals, or dynamic content loading.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests for individual components and functions.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Ensure the home page integrates well with existing site components.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct peer reviews to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Configure the build process to include the new home page.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Update the CI/CD pipeline to deploy the home page to staging and production.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Implement monitoring to track the performance and uptime of the home page.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Verify that the home page loads within 2 seconds - Expected: Page load time is â‰¤ 2 seconds.
- **Test Case 2**: Check that all navigation links are functional - Expected: All links redirect to the correct pages.
- **Test Case 3**: Ensure the home page is responsive on mobile devices - Expected: Page layout adjusts correctly on various screen sizes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The home page design matches the approved mockups.
- [ ] All interactive elements function as intended.
- [ ] The page is responsive and performs well on all major browsers.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (if applicable)
- **Performance**: Page should load in under 2 seconds.
- **Security**: Ensure no vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- **Scalability**: Design should accommodate future content and feature additions.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Delays in design approval - Mitigation: Schedule regular check-ins with the design team.
- **Medium Risk**: Browser compatibility issues - Mitigation: Test on all major browsers early in the development process.
- **Low Risk**: Minor styling discrepancies - Mitigation: Use a style guide to maintain consistency.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 week - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 weeks - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 week - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 week - Deployment

This plan outlines the steps necessary to successfully deliver a new home page for our web application, ensuring a smooth and efficient development process.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the new home page feature according to the provided plan, we will follow a structured approach. Here's a step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Create a new branch for the home page feature.
   - Command: `git checkout -b feature/home-page`

2. **Development Environment**
   - Ensure all team members have the necessary tools and access.
   - Verify that everyone has access to the repository and necessary permissions.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Identify any new libraries or frameworks needed for the home page.
   - Install dependencies using a package manager like npm or yarn.
   - Example: `npm install react-router-dom` (if using React for navigation)

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Design Mockups**
   - Collaborate with the design team to create wireframes and mockups.
   - Use tools like Figma or Adobe XD for design collaboration.

2. **HTML/CSS Structure**
   - Develop the basic structure and styling of the home page.
   - Create a new React component for the home page if applicable.
   - Use CSS or a preprocessor like SASS for styling.
   - Ensure the design is responsive using media queries.

3. **JavaScript Functionality**
   - Implement interactive elements such as sliders, modals, or dynamic content loading.
   - Use React state and lifecycle methods/hooks for dynamic content.
   - Example: Implement a carousel using a library like `react-slick`.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write tests for individual components and functions using a testing library like Jest.
   - Example: Test that the home page component renders correctly.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Ensure the home page integrates well with existing site components.
   - Use tools like Cypress for end-to-end testing.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct peer reviews to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.
   - Use pull requests on GitHub for code review.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Configure the build process to include the new home page.
   - Ensure the build script compiles the new components correctly.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Update the CI/CD pipeline to deploy the home page to staging and production.
   - Use tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or Travis CI for automation.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement monitoring to track the performance and uptime of the home page.
   - Use tools like Google Analytics or New Relic for performance monitoring.

### Testing

- **Test Case 1**: Verify that the home page loads within 2 seconds.
- **Test Case 2**: Check that all navigation links are functional.
- **Test Case 3**: Ensure the home page is responsive on mobile devices.

### Documentation

- Update the project documentation to include details about the new home page.
- Document any new dependencies or setup instructions.

### Final Steps

- Ensure all acceptance criteria are met.
- Conduct a final review and approval process.
- Merge the feature branch into the main branch after successful testing and review.

By following this strategy, we can ensure a smooth and efficient development process for the new home page feature.
