   - [ ] Unit tests: Write unit tests to cover the new feature and ensure the Git path fix is effective.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Conduct integration tests to verify that the feature works seamlessly with other components.
   - [ ] Code review: Perform a thorough code review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Configure the build process to include the new feature and path fix.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Set up a deployment pipeline to automate the release of the feature to staging/production.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Implement monitoring to track the performance and stability of the feature post-deployment.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Validate that the Git path fix resolves the original issue - Expected: No path-related errors occur.
- **Test Case 2**: Ensure the new feature functions correctly with the fixed path - Expected: Feature operates as intended without errors.
- **Test Case 3**: Verify that existing functionalities are unaffected by the path fix - Expected: No regression in existing features.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The Git path issue is resolved and verified through testing.
- [ ] The new feature is implemented and functions correctly.
- [ ] No regression issues are introduced by the path fix.
- [ ] All tests pass successfully.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Git, [Programming Language/Framework], CI/CD tools
- **Performance**: The feature should not degrade the performance of the application.
- **Security**: Ensure that the path fix does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.
- **Scalability**: The solution should be scalable to accommodate future enhancements.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Potential for the path fix to introduce new issues - Mitigation: Extensive testing and code review.
- **Medium Risk**: Integration challenges with existing codebase - Mitigation: Careful planning and incremental integration.
- **Low Risk**: Minor performance impacts - Mitigation: Performance testing and optimization.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 week - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 weeks - Core Development and Testing
- **Phase 3**: 1 week - Deployment and Monitoring

This plan provides a structured approach to testing the Git path fix with a simple feature, ensuring that the fix is effective and does not negatively impact the existing system.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the project plan for testing the Git path fix with a simple feature, we will follow a structured approach. Here's a step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Ensure the repository is updated with the latest changes, including the Git path fix.
   - Verify that the Git path fix is correctly applied by checking the relevant configuration files or scripts.

2. **Development Environment Setup**
   - Set up your development environment to replicate the issue. This may involve configuring your IDE, setting environment variables, or adjusting system paths.
   - Document any specific configurations needed to replicate the issue and test the fix.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Identify all necessary dependencies required for the development and testing of the feature.
   - Use a package manager (e.g., npm, pip) to install these dependencies.
   - Verify that all dependencies are correctly installed and up-to-date.

### Phase 2: Core Development

4. **Implement Simple Feature**
   - Design a simple feature that interacts with the Git path. This could be a script or a small application component.
   - Use Cursor AI to generate the initial code for the feature, ensuring it interacts with the Git path as intended.
   - Manually review and refine the generated code to ensure it meets the project requirements.

5. **Integrate with Existing Codebase**
   - Integrate the new feature into the existing codebase.
   - Ensure that the integration does not disrupt existing functionalities.
   - Refactor any affected code to accommodate the new feature and path fix.

6. **Refactor Code**
   - Identify any areas of the codebase that require refactoring due to the new feature or path fix.
   - Apply best practices for code refactoring, such as improving readability, reducing complexity, and enhancing maintainability.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

7. **Unit Testing**
   - Write unit tests to cover the new feature and validate the effectiveness of the Git path fix.
   - Use a testing framework (e.g., Jest, PyTest) to automate the execution of these tests.
   - Ensure all unit tests pass successfully.

8. **Integration Testing**
   - Conduct integration tests to verify that the new feature works seamlessly with other components.
   - Test the feature in various scenarios to ensure robustness and reliability.

9. **Code Review**
   - Perform a thorough code review with peers or use automated tools to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.
   - Address any feedback or issues identified during the review process.

### Phase 4: Deployment

10. **Build Process Configuration**
    - Configure the build process to include the new feature and path fix.
    - Ensure that the build process is automated and reliable.

11. **Deployment Pipeline Setup**
    - Set up a deployment pipeline using CI/CD tools to automate the release of the feature to staging/production.
    - Test the deployment pipeline to ensure it functions correctly.

12. **Monitoring Setup**
    - Implement monitoring tools to track the performance and stability of the feature post-deployment.
    - Set up alerts for any anomalies or issues detected during monitoring.

### Test Cases

- **Test Case 1**: Validate that the Git path fix resolves the original issue.
- **Test Case 2**: Ensure the new feature functions correctly with the fixed path.
- **Test Case 3**: Verify that existing functionalities are unaffected by the path fix.

### Final Steps

- Ensure all acceptance criteria are met.
- Update documentation to reflect changes and new features.
- Conduct a final review and approval process before deploying to production.

By following this step-by-step strategy, we can effectively implement and validate the Git path fix with a simple feature, ensuring the integrity and functionality of the system.
