        # Project Plan: Add a Simple /status Endpoint that Returns System Uptime

## Overview
The task is to implement a new API endpoint `/status` that returns the system's uptime. This endpoint will provide a simple JSON response indicating how long the system has been running since the last restart. This feature is useful for monitoring and ensuring the system's reliability and availability.

## Definition of Done

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Implement the `/status` endpoint in the application.
   - [ ] Calculate system uptime using system libraries or utilities.
   - [ ] Format the uptime data into a JSON response.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests to verify the uptime calculation and endpoint response.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Ensure the endpoint integrates correctly with the existing system.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a peer review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

   - [ ] Build process: Ensure the application builds successfully with the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Update the deployment pipeline to include the new feature.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Add monitoring for the new endpoint to track its usage and performance.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Request to `/status` endpoint - Expected: JSON response with uptime in seconds.
- **Test Case 2**: System uptime calculation - Expected: Correct calculation of uptime since the last restart.
- **Test Case 3**: Endpoint availability - Expected: Endpoint should be available and responsive under normal load.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The `/status` endpoint returns a JSON object with the system uptime.
- [ ] The uptime is calculated accurately and reflects the time since the last system restart.
- [ ] The endpoint is accessible and performs efficiently under expected load conditions.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express.js (or relevant framework)
- **Performance**: The endpoint should respond within 100ms under normal conditions.
- **Security**: Ensure the endpoint does not expose sensitive information.
- **Scalability**: The solution should handle increased load without degradation in performance.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: None identified.
- **Medium Risk**: Incorrect uptime calculation - Mitigation: Thorough testing and validation.
- **Low Risk**: Endpoint performance issues - Mitigation: Performance testing and optimization.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 day - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 days - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 day - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 day - Deployment

This plan outlines the steps necessary to implement the `/status` endpoint, ensuring it is developed, tested, and deployed efficiently. The focus is on delivering a reliable and performant feature that meets the outlined requirements.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the `/status` endpoint that returns the system's uptime, we'll follow a structured approach based on the provided plan. Here's a detailed step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Step 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Ensure the repository is up-to-date by pulling the latest changes from the main branch.
   - Create a new feature branch for the `/status` endpoint implementation, e.g., `feature/status-endpoint`.

2. **Development Environment**
   - Verify that the development environment is correctly configured with Node.js and Express.js.
   - Ensure that any necessary environment variables or configurations are set up.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Check if all necessary dependencies are installed. If Express.js is not installed, add it to the project using:
     ```bash
     npm install express
     ```

### Step 2: Core Development

1. **Implement the `/status` Endpoint**
   - Create a new route in your Express.js application for the `/status` endpoint.
   - Use Node.js's `os` module to calculate the system uptime.

2. **Calculate System Uptime**
   - Use the `os.uptime()` function to get the system uptime in seconds.

3. **Format the Uptime Data into a JSON Response**
   - Structure the response to return a JSON object with the uptime information.

Example implementation in Express.js:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const os = require('os');

const app = express();

app.get('/status', (req, res) => {
    const uptime = os.uptime(); // Get system uptime in seconds
    res.json({ uptime });
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

### Step 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests to verify the uptime calculation and the response format.
   - Use a testing framework like Mocha or Jest for writing tests.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Ensure the `/status` endpoint integrates correctly with the existing system.
   - Test the endpoint's availability and response under normal load conditions.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a peer review to ensure the code adheres to best practices and standards.

Example test case using Jest:

```javascript
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('./app'); // Assuming your Express app is exported from app.js

describe('GET /status', () => {
    it('should return system uptime in JSON format', async () => {
        const response = await request(app).get('/status');
        expect(response.statusCode).toBe(200);
        expect(response.body).toHaveProperty('uptime');
        expect(typeof response.body.uptime).toBe('number');
    });
});
```

### Step 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Ensure the application builds successfully with the new endpoint.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Update the deployment pipeline to include the new feature.
   - Deploy the changes to the staging environment for further testing.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Add monitoring for the new endpoint to track its usage and performance.
   - Use tools like New Relic or Datadog for monitoring.

### Step 5: Documentation

- Update the project documentation to include details about the new `/status` endpoint.
- Document the API endpoint, expected response format, and any relevant usage notes.

### Step 6: Final Review and Deployment

- Ensure all tests are passing and the code has been reviewed and approved.
- Deploy the feature to production once it has been validated in the staging environment.

By following these steps, we ensure a thorough and efficient implementation of the `/status` endpoint, meeting all the acceptance criteria and technical requirements outlined in the plan.
