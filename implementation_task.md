        # Project Plan: Add an Endpoint for Config

## Overview
The task involves creating a new API endpoint that allows clients to retrieve configuration settings. This endpoint will provide a structured response containing various configuration parameters necessary for client applications to function correctly. The endpoint should be secure, efficient, and scalable to handle multiple requests simultaneously.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing

- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the repository is up-to-date and branch is created for the feature.
   - [ ] Development environment: Configure local development environment with necessary tools and access.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Install any new dependencies required for the endpoint.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Define endpoint route and method (e.g., GET /api/config).
   - [ ] Implement logic to fetch configuration settings from the database or configuration files.
   - [ ] Structure the response in a JSON format with appropriate status codes.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests to cover the endpoint logic and response structure.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Ensure the endpoint works correctly with other parts of the system.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a peer review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Ensure the build process includes the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Update the CI/CD pipeline to include tests and deployment of the new feature.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Implement monitoring to track the endpoint's performance and usage.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Retrieve configuration with valid request - Expected: 200 OK with JSON response containing configuration settings.
- **Test Case 2**: Retrieve configuration with invalid authentication - Expected: 401 Unauthorized.
- **Test Case 3**: Retrieve configuration when service is down - Expected: 503 Service Unavailable.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Endpoint returns configuration settings in JSON format.
- [ ] Endpoint is secured with authentication.
- [ ] Endpoint handles errors gracefully and returns appropriate status codes.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB (or relevant database), JWT for authentication.
- **Performance**: Endpoint should respond within 200ms under normal load.
- **Security**: Implement JWT authentication and ensure data is sanitized.
- **Scalability**: Design endpoint to handle at least 1000 requests per second.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Security vulnerabilities - Mitigation: Conduct thorough security testing and code review.
- **Medium Risk**: Performance issues under load - Mitigation: Load testing and optimization.
- **Low Risk**: Integration with existing systems - Mitigation: Comprehensive integration testing.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 week - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 weeks - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 week - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 week - Deployment and Monitoring Setup

This plan provides a structured approach to implementing the new configuration endpoint, ensuring all aspects of development, testing, and deployment are covered.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the new API endpoint for retrieving configuration settings, we will follow a structured approach based on the provided plan. Here's a detailed step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Ensure the repository is up-to-date by pulling the latest changes from the main branch.
   - Create a new feature branch for the endpoint, e.g., `feature/config-endpoint`.

2. **Development Environment**
   - Verify that the local development environment is configured with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
   - Ensure access to the database and any necessary configuration files.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Review the project dependencies and install any new packages required for JWT authentication or other functionalities using `npm install`.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Define Endpoint Route and Method**
   - In the Express application, define a new route for the endpoint, e.g., `GET /api/config`.

2. **Implement Logic to Fetch Configuration Settings**
   - Create a service or utility function to fetch configuration settings from the database or configuration files.
   - Ensure the function handles potential errors, such as database connection issues.

3. **Structure the Response**
   - Format the response in JSON, including necessary configuration parameters.
   - Implement appropriate HTTP status codes for success (200 OK) and error scenarios.

4. **Secure the Endpoint**
   - Implement JWT authentication middleware to secure the endpoint.
   - Ensure the endpoint checks for valid tokens and returns a 401 Unauthorized status for invalid requests.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests for the service function that fetches configuration settings.
   - Test various scenarios, including successful data retrieval and error handling.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Develop integration tests to ensure the endpoint works correctly with the authentication middleware and other system components.
   - Use a testing framework like Mocha or Jest for test execution.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a peer review of the code to ensure it meets quality standards and follows best practices.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Update the build process to include the new endpoint.
   - Ensure all tests pass before proceeding with deployment.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Update the CI/CD pipeline to include the new feature.
   - Deploy the changes to the staging environment for further testing.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement monitoring tools to track the endpoint's performance and usage.
   - Set up alerts for any anomalies or performance issues.

### Test Cases

- **Test Case 1**: Validate successful retrieval of configuration settings with a valid request.
- **Test Case 2**: Ensure the endpoint returns a 401 Unauthorized status for requests with invalid authentication.
- **Test Case 3**: Simulate service downtime and verify the endpoint returns a 503 Service Unavailable status.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Ensure the endpoint returns configuration settings in JSON format.
- Verify the endpoint is secured with JWT authentication.
- Confirm the endpoint handles errors gracefully and returns appropriate status codes.

### Technical Considerations

- Ensure the endpoint responds within 200ms under normal load.
- Conduct load testing to verify scalability and performance.
- Perform thorough security testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

By following this strategy, we will implement a secure, efficient, and scalable configuration endpoint that meets the project's requirements and acceptance criteria.
