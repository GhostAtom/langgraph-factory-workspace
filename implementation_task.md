        # Project Plan: Add a Simple /status Endpoint that Returns System Uptime

## Overview
The goal of this project is to implement a new `/status` endpoint in the existing application. This endpoint will provide information about the system's uptime, allowing users and administrators to monitor the application's availability and performance.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the repository is up-to-date and branch is created for the feature.
   - [ ] Development environment: Confirm that the local development environment is configured correctly.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Verify that all necessary dependencies are installed and up-to-date.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Implement the `/status` endpoint in the application.
   - [ ] Retrieve system uptime using appropriate system calls or libraries.
   - [ ] Format the uptime data into a JSON response.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests to verify the endpoint returns the correct uptime.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Ensure the endpoint integrates correctly with the existing system.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a peer review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Ensure the application builds successfully with the new changes.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Update the CI/CD pipeline to include the new feature.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Implement monitoring for the new endpoint to track its usage and performance.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Request the `/status` endpoint - Expected: Returns a JSON object with the system uptime.
- **Test Case 2**: Simulate system uptime of 1 hour - Expected: Endpoint returns uptime of approximately 3600 seconds.
- **Test Case 3**: Endpoint response time - Expected: Response time is within acceptable limits (e.g., < 200ms).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The `/status` endpoint is accessible and returns a JSON response.
- [ ] The response includes the correct system uptime.
- [ ] The endpoint is documented in the API documentation.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express (or relevant framework), System libraries for uptime retrieval
- **Performance**: Endpoint should respond within 200ms under normal load.
- **Security**: Ensure the endpoint does not expose sensitive information.
- **Scalability**: The endpoint should handle concurrent requests efficiently.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: None identified.
- **Medium Risk**: Incorrect uptime calculation - Mitigation: Thorough testing and validation.
- **Low Risk**: Minor performance impact - Mitigation: Monitor and optimize if necessary.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 day - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 days - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 day - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 day - Deployment

This plan outlines the steps necessary to successfully implement and deploy the `/status` endpoint, ensuring it meets all functional and non-functional requirements.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the `/status` endpoint that returns system uptime, we will follow a structured approach based on the provided plan. Here's a detailed step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Ensure the repository is up-to-date by pulling the latest changes from the main branch.
   - Create a new feature branch for the `/status` endpoint implementation, e.g., `feature/status-endpoint`.

2. **Development Environment**
   - Verify that the local development environment is correctly configured with Node.js and any necessary tools.
   - Ensure the application runs without errors in the current setup.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Check for any new dependencies required for uptime retrieval. If using Node.js, the `os` module is built-in and can be used for this purpose.
   - Run `npm install` to ensure all existing dependencies are up-to-date.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Implement the `/status` Endpoint**
   - Create a new route in the Express application for the `/status` endpoint.
   - Use the `os` module to retrieve the system uptime.

2. **Retrieve System Uptime**
   - Use `os.uptime()` to get the system uptime in seconds.
   - Convert the uptime to a more readable format if necessary (e.g., hours, minutes, seconds).

3. **Format the Uptime Data**
   - Construct a JSON response that includes the uptime information.
   - Example response: `{ "uptime": 3600 }`

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests to verify that the `/status` endpoint returns the correct uptime.
   - Use a testing framework like Mocha or Jest for writing and running tests.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Ensure the endpoint integrates correctly with the existing system.
   - Test the endpoint's response time to ensure it meets performance criteria.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a peer review of the code to ensure it adheres to coding standards and best practices.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Ensure the application builds successfully with the new changes.
   - Run any build scripts or processes required for deployment.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Update the CI/CD pipeline to include the new feature.
   - Deploy the changes to a staging environment for further testing.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement monitoring for the new endpoint to track its usage and performance.
   - Use tools like New Relic or Datadog for monitoring.

### Additional Steps

- **Documentation**
  - Update the API documentation to include details about the new `/status` endpoint.
  - Document the expected JSON response and any relevant information about the uptime calculation.

- **Acceptance Criteria Verification**
  - Ensure the `/status` endpoint is accessible and returns the correct JSON response.
  - Verify that the response includes the correct system uptime.
  - Confirm that the endpoint is documented in the API documentation.

By following this strategy, we can ensure a smooth implementation of the `/status` endpoint, meeting all functional and non-functional requirements. Let's proceed with the implementation, starting with setting up the repository and environment.
