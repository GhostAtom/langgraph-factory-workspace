        # Project Plan: Create Azure Resource Group for MVP

## Overview
The objective of this project is to create an Azure Resource Group to support the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) deployment. This involves setting up a structured environment in Azure to host and manage the necessary resources for the MVP, ensuring scalability, security, and efficient resource management.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts
   - [ ] Development environment configured with Azure CLI and necessary tools
   - [ ] Dependencies installation, including Terraform or ARM templates

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Define the Azure Resource Group configuration
   - [ ] Implement IaC scripts to automate the creation of the Resource Group
   - [ ] Configure access controls and permissions for the Resource Group

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests for IaC scripts
   - [ ] Integration tests to ensure resources are correctly provisioned
   - [ ] Code review to ensure best practices and compliance

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process for IaC scripts
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline setup for automated provisioning
   - [ ] Monitoring setup for resource usage and performance

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Validate Resource Group creation - Expected: Resource Group is created successfully in the specified Azure region.
- **Test Case 2**: Verify access controls - Expected: Only authorized users can access the Resource Group.
- **Test Case 3**: Check resource provisioning - Expected: All specified resources are provisioned within the Resource Group.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Resource Group is created in the specified Azure region
- [ ] Access controls are correctly configured
- [ ] All necessary resources for the MVP are provisioned within the Resource Group

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Azure, Azure CLI, Terraform/ARM templates
- **Performance**: Resource Group should support the MVP's performance requirements
- **Security**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and network security groups (NSGs)
- **Scalability**: Resource Group should be able to scale to accommodate additional resources as needed

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Misconfiguration of access controls - Mitigation: Implement thorough testing and code reviews
- **Medium Risk**: Resource limits exceeded - Mitigation: Monitor usage and adjust quotas as necessary
- **Low Risk**: Delays in provisioning - Mitigation: Use automated scripts to ensure timely deployment

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 week - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 weeks - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 week - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 week - Deployment

This plan provides a structured approach to creating an Azure Resource Group for the MVP, ensuring that all necessary resources are provisioned and managed effectively.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the project plan for creating an Azure Resource Group for the MVP, we will follow a structured approach, breaking down the tasks into manageable steps. Here's a detailed implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Scripts**
   - Create a new GitHub repository for the project.
   - Initialize the repository with a README file and a `.gitignore` for Terraform or ARM templates.
   - Set up the repository structure to organize IaC scripts, documentation, and tests.

2. **Development Environment Configuration**
   - Install and configure the Azure CLI on your local development environment.
   - Ensure you have access to the Azure subscription where the Resource Group will be created.
   - Install Terraform or set up ARM templates, depending on the chosen IaC tool.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - If using Terraform, install the necessary Terraform version and any required plugins.
   - If using ARM templates, ensure you have the necessary tools to validate and deploy templates.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Define the Azure Resource Group Configuration**
   - Determine the Azure region where the Resource Group will be created.
   - Define the naming conventions and tags for the Resource Group to ensure consistency and manageability.

2. **Implement IaC Scripts**
   - Write Terraform scripts or ARM templates to automate the creation of the Resource Group.
   - Ensure the scripts include parameters for region, tags, and any other configurable options.

3. **Configure Access Controls and Permissions**
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) within the IaC scripts to define who can access the Resource Group.
   - Set up network security groups (NSGs) if necessary to control inbound and outbound traffic.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests for IaC Scripts**
   - Write unit tests to validate the syntax and logic of the IaC scripts.
   - Use tools like `terraform validate` or ARM template validation to ensure correctness.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Deploy the Resource Group in a test environment to verify that all resources are provisioned correctly.
   - Check that the Resource Group is created in the specified region and that access controls are applied.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a thorough code review to ensure adherence to best practices and compliance with security standards.
   - Address any feedback or issues identified during the review process.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process for IaC Scripts**
   - Set up a build process to package and prepare the IaC scripts for deployment.
   - Ensure the build process includes validation and testing steps.

2. **Deployment Pipeline Setup**
   - Configure a CI/CD pipeline using tools like GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, or Jenkins to automate the provisioning of the Resource Group.
   - Include steps for deploying to staging and production environments.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement monitoring for the Resource Group to track resource usage and performance.
   - Set up alerts for any anomalies or issues that may arise.

### Testing and Validation

- **Test Case 1**: Deploy the Resource Group and verify its creation in the specified Azure region.
- **Test Case 2**: Test access controls by attempting to access the Resource Group with authorized and unauthorized users.
- **Test Case 3**: Ensure all specified resources are provisioned within the Resource Group and are functioning as expected.

### Documentation

- Update the project documentation to include setup instructions, usage guidelines, and any relevant architectural decisions.
- Document the testing process and results to provide transparency and traceability.

### Final Steps

- Review the implementation against the acceptance criteria to ensure all requirements are met.
- Conduct a final review and approval process before deploying to production.
- Commit all changes to the repository with descriptive commit messages, ensuring a clear history of the implementation process.

By following this step-by-step strategy, we can ensure a successful implementation of the Azure Resource Group for the MVP, meeting all technical and business requirements.
