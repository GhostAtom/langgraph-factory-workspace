        # Project Plan: Add User Authentication

## Overview
The goal of this project is to implement OAuth2 authentication for user login. This will enhance the security of the application by allowing users to log in using a secure and standardized authentication protocol. The feature will support multiple OAuth2 providers, such as Google, Facebook, and GitHub, to offer flexibility and convenience to users.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the repository is ready for development with the latest codebase.
   - [ ] Development environment: Configure local development environments with necessary tools and configurations.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Install required libraries and packages for OAuth2 integration.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Implement OAuth2 client: Develop the client-side logic to initiate and handle OAuth2 authentication flows.
   - [ ] Integrate with OAuth2 providers: Set up and configure connections with Google, Facebook, and GitHub.
   - [ ] User session management: Develop backend logic to manage user sessions and store authentication tokens securely.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests to cover the OAuth2 authentication logic and session management.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Test the complete authentication flow with each OAuth2 provider.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a thorough review of the code to ensure quality and adherence to best practices.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Ensure the build process includes all necessary steps for OAuth2 integration.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Update the CI/CD pipeline to handle new dependencies and configurations.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Implement monitoring to track authentication success rates and potential issues.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: User logs in with Google - Expected: User is authenticated and redirected to the dashboard.
- **Test Case 2**: User logs in with Facebook - Expected: User is authenticated and redirected to the dashboard.
- **Test Case 3**: User logs in with GitHub - Expected: User is authenticated and redirected to the dashboard.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can log in using Google, Facebook, and GitHub.
- [ ] Authentication tokens are securely stored and managed.
- [ ] The application redirects users to the dashboard upon successful login.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express, Passport.js, OAuth2
- **Performance**: Authentication should complete within 2 seconds.
- **Security**: Tokens must be stored securely, and sensitive data should be encrypted.
- **Scalability**: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent authentication requests.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in OAuth2 implementation - Mitigation: Conduct thorough security audits and use well-maintained libraries.
- **Medium Risk**: Integration issues with OAuth2 providers - Mitigation: Test extensively with each provider and maintain updated documentation.
- **Low Risk**: User experience issues during login - Mitigation: Conduct user testing and gather feedback for improvements.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 week - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 weeks - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 week - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 week - Deployment

This plan outlines the steps necessary to implement OAuth2 authentication, ensuring a secure and user-friendly login experience. The focus is on delivering a robust solution that meets all technical and user requirements.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the OAuth2 authentication feature as outlined in the project plan, we will follow a structured approach. Here's a detailed step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Ensure the repository is up-to-date with the latest codebase.
   - Create a new branch for the OAuth2 authentication feature to keep changes isolated.

2. **Development Environment Configuration**
   - Set up local development environments with Node.js and Express.
   - Ensure all team members have the necessary tools installed, such as Node.js, npm, and Git.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Install necessary libraries for OAuth2 integration, primarily focusing on `passport`, `passport-google-oauth20`, `passport-facebook`, and `passport-github`.
   - Update the `package.json` file to include these dependencies.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Implement OAuth2 Client**
   - Set up Passport.js strategies for Google, Facebook, and GitHub.
   - Create routes to handle authentication requests and callbacks for each provider.

2. **Integrate with OAuth2 Providers**
   - Register the application with Google, Facebook, and GitHub to obtain client IDs and secrets.
   - Configure Passport.js strategies with the obtained credentials.
   - Implement middleware to initiate authentication flows and handle provider callbacks.

3. **User Session Management**
   - Use Express sessions to manage user sessions.
   - Securely store authentication tokens using environment variables and encryption.
   - Implement logic to serialize and deserialize user information for session management.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests for the OAuth2 authentication logic using a testing framework like Mocha or Jest.
   - Ensure tests cover all critical paths, including successful and failed authentication attempts.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test the complete authentication flow with each OAuth2 provider.
   - Simulate user interactions to ensure the application behaves as expected.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a thorough code review to ensure adherence to best practices and code quality.
   - Address any feedback or issues identified during the review process.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Update the build process to include all necessary steps for OAuth2 integration.
   - Ensure the build is optimized for performance and security.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Update the CI/CD pipeline to handle new dependencies and configurations.
   - Test the deployment process in a staging environment before moving to production.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement monitoring to track authentication success rates and potential issues.
   - Use tools like New Relic or Datadog to monitor application performance and security.

### Additional Considerations

- **Documentation**
  - Update the project documentation to include setup instructions, usage guidelines, and troubleshooting tips for OAuth2 authentication.

- **Security Audits**
  - Conduct security audits to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in the OAuth2 implementation.

- **User Testing**
  - Conduct user testing to gather feedback on the login experience and make necessary improvements.

By following this implementation strategy, we aim to deliver a robust and secure OAuth2 authentication feature that meets all technical and user requirements.
