        # Project Plan: Add a Simple /status Endpoint that Returns System Uptime

## Overview
The goal of this project is to implement a new `/status` endpoint in the existing application. This endpoint will return the system's uptime, providing a simple way to monitor the application's availability and performance.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the repository is up-to-date and branch is created for the feature.
   - [ ] Development environment: Confirm the development environment is configured correctly.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Verify all necessary dependencies are installed.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Implement the `/status` endpoint in the application.
   - [ ] Calculate system uptime using system libraries or APIs.
   - [ ] Format the uptime response in a human-readable format (e.g., days, hours, minutes).

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests to verify the uptime calculation and endpoint response.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Ensure the endpoint integrates correctly with the existing system.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a peer review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Ensure the application builds successfully with the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Update the CI/CD pipeline to include the new feature.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Implement monitoring for the new endpoint to track its usage and performance.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Request the `/status` endpoint - Expected: Returns uptime in a human-readable format.
- **Test Case 2**: Simulate system restart and request `/status` - Expected: Uptime resets and reflects the new start time.
- **Test Case 3**: Request `/status` under high load - Expected: Endpoint responds correctly without performance degradation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The `/status` endpoint returns the system uptime in a human-readable format.
- [ ] The endpoint is accessible and responds within acceptable time limits.
- [ ] The implementation does not degrade the performance of the existing system.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express (or relevant framework)
- **Performance**: Endpoint should respond in under 200ms under normal load.
- **Security**: Ensure the endpoint does not expose sensitive information.
- **Scalability**: The solution should handle increased load without performance degradation.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: None identified.
- **Medium Risk**: Potential for incorrect uptime calculation due to system time changes - Mitigation: Use reliable system APIs.
- **Low Risk**: Minor performance impact - Mitigation: Optimize code and conduct load testing.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 day - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 days - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 day - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 day - Deployment

This plan provides a structured approach to implementing the `/status` endpoint, ensuring that all aspects of development, testing, and deployment are covered.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the `/status` endpoint that returns the system uptime, we will follow a structured approach based on the provided plan. Here's a detailed step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Ensure the repository is up-to-date by pulling the latest changes from the main branch.
   - Create a new feature branch for the `/status` endpoint implementation, e.g., `feature/status-endpoint`.

2. **Development Environment**
   - Verify that the development environment is correctly configured with the necessary tools and versions (Node.js, npm, etc.).
   - Ensure the application is running locally without errors.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Check if any additional dependencies are required for uptime calculation. If so, install them using npm.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Implement the `/status` Endpoint**
   - Add a new route in the Express application for the `/status` endpoint.
   - Use Node.js built-in libraries like `os` or `process` to calculate the system uptime.

2. **Calculate System Uptime**
   - Use `process.uptime()` to get the system uptime in seconds.
   - Convert the uptime into a human-readable format (days, hours, minutes).

3. **Format the Uptime Response**
   - Create a function to format the uptime into a string, e.g., "2 days, 3 hours, 15 minutes".
   - Ensure the response is JSON formatted and includes the uptime string.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests to verify the uptime calculation logic.
   - Test the formatting function to ensure it correctly converts seconds into a human-readable format.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test the `/status` endpoint to ensure it integrates correctly with the existing application.
   - Simulate different scenarios, such as system restarts, to verify uptime resets.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a peer review of the implemented code to ensure it meets quality standards and follows best practices.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Ensure the application builds successfully with the new `/status` endpoint.
   - Run all tests to confirm they pass without issues.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Update the CI/CD pipeline to include the new feature.
   - Deploy the changes to a staging environment for further testing.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement monitoring for the `/status` endpoint to track its usage and performance.
   - Set up alerts for any anomalies or performance issues.

### Additional Considerations

- **Documentation**
  - Update the application documentation to include details about the new `/status` endpoint.
  - Provide examples of how to use the endpoint and interpret the response.

- **Security**
  - Ensure the endpoint does not expose any sensitive information.
  - Consider rate limiting to prevent abuse under high load.

- **Performance Testing**
  - Conduct load testing to ensure the endpoint performs well under increased load.
  - Optimize the code if necessary to meet the performance criteria.

By following this strategy, we can ensure a smooth implementation of the `/status` endpoint, meeting all the acceptance criteria and technical requirements outlined in the plan.
