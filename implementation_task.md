This plan outlines the steps necessary to create a simple Python calculator, ensuring that all aspects of software delivery are considered for successful project completion.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the Simple Python Calculator project, we will follow the outlined plan and break it down into detailed steps. Here's a step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Create a new Git repository on GitHub for the project.
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Initialize the repository with a README file that outlines the project purpose and basic usage instructions.

2. **Development Environment**
   - Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine. You can verify this by running `python --version` or `python3 --version`.
   - Set up a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
     ```

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Install necessary libraries, such as `pytest` for testing:
     ```bash
     pip install pytest
     ```

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Implement Addition Functionality**
   - Create a Python file, e.g., `calculator.py`.
   - Implement a function to add two numbers:
     ```python
     def add(a, b):
         return a + b
     ```

2. **Implement Subtraction Functionality**
   - Add a function to subtract one number from another:
     ```python
     def subtract(a, b):
         return a - b
     ```

3. **Implement Multiplication Functionality**
   - Add a function to multiply two numbers:
     ```python
     def multiply(a, b):
         return a * b
     ```

4. **Implement Division Functionality**
   - Add a function to divide one number by another, handling division by zero:
     ```python
     def divide(a, b):
         if b == 0:
             raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
         return a / b
     ```

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Create a test file, e.g., `test_calculator.py`.
   - Write unit tests for each arithmetic function using `pytest`:
     ```python
     import pytest
     from calculator import add, subtract, multiply, divide

     def test_add():
         assert add(2, 3) == 5

     def test_subtract():
         assert subtract(5, 3) == 2

     def test_multiply():
         assert multiply(2, 3) == 6

     def test_divide():
         assert divide(6, 3) == 2
         with pytest.raises(ValueError):
             divide(6, 0)
     ```

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test the calculator as a whole by simulating user input and output.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a peer review of the code to ensure quality and adherence to standards.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Create a script to package the application for distribution, if necessary.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Set up a simple deployment pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement basic logging to monitor application usage and errors.

### Final Steps

- **Documentation**
  - Update the README file with detailed usage instructions and examples.
  
- **Commit and Push Changes**
  - Commit your changes with descriptive messages:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Implement basic arithmetic functions and tests"
    git push origin main
    ```

- **Verification**
  - Ensure all tests pass and the application meets the acceptance criteria.

By following these steps, you will have a fully functional simple Python calculator that meets the project requirements.
