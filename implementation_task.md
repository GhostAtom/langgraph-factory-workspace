        # Project Plan: Add a Simple Test Endpoint

## Overview
The objective of this project is to add a simple test endpoint to the existing application. This endpoint will be used to verify the basic functionality and connectivity of the application. It should return a static message indicating that the application is running correctly.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the repository is up-to-date and accessible.
   - [ ] Development environment: Confirm that the development environment is configured correctly.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Verify that all necessary dependencies are installed.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Create a new route for the test endpoint.
   - [ ] Implement the logic to return a static message (e.g., "Application is running").
   - [ ] Ensure the endpoint is accessible via HTTP GET request.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests to verify the endpoint returns the correct message.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Ensure the endpoint integrates correctly with the existing application.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a peer review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Update the build process to include the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Ensure the deployment pipeline is configured to deploy the changes.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Set up monitoring to track the usage and performance of the new endpoint.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Access the test endpoint via HTTP GET - Expected: Returns "Application is running".
- **Test Case 2**: Access the test endpoint with incorrect HTTP method - Expected: Returns method not allowed error.
- **Test Case 3**: Access the test endpoint with invalid URL - Expected: Returns 404 error.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The test endpoint returns a static message indicating the application is running.
- [ ] The endpoint is accessible via HTTP GET request.
- [ ] All tests pass successfully.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express.js (or relevant framework)
- **Performance**: The endpoint should respond within 200ms under normal load.
- **Security**: Ensure the endpoint does not expose any sensitive information.
- **Scalability**: The endpoint should handle a minimum of 100 requests per second.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: None identified.
- **Medium Risk**: Potential for incorrect endpoint configuration - Mitigation: Thorough testing and code review.
- **Low Risk**: Minor performance issues - Mitigation: Monitor and optimize as necessary.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 day - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 days - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 day - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 day - Deployment

This plan provides a structured approach to adding a simple test endpoint, ensuring that all necessary steps are taken to deliver a quality feature.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the plan of adding a simple test endpoint to the existing application, we will follow a structured approach. Here's a step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Ensure the repository is up-to-date by pulling the latest changes from the main branch.
   - Verify that you have the necessary permissions to push changes.

2. **Development Environment**
   - Confirm that your development environment is configured correctly with the necessary tools (e.g., Node.js, npm).
   - Ensure that the application runs without errors in the local environment.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Check the `package.json` file for any missing dependencies and install them using `npm install`.
   - Verify that all dependencies are up-to-date and compatible.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Create a New Route for the Test Endpoint**
   - Open the main server file (e.g., `app.js` or `server.js`).
   - Define a new route for the test endpoint using Express.js.

2. **Implement the Logic to Return a Static Message**
   - In the route handler, implement logic to return a static message, such as "Application is running".
   - Ensure the message is returned as a JSON response.

3. **Ensure the Endpoint is Accessible via HTTP GET Request**
   - Verify that the route is correctly set up to handle HTTP GET requests.
   - Test the endpoint locally to ensure it responds as expected.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests to verify that the endpoint returns the correct static message.
   - Use a testing framework like Mocha or Jest for writing tests.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Write integration tests to ensure the endpoint integrates correctly with the existing application.
   - Test the endpoint's response and status code.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a peer review of the code to ensure it meets quality standards and adheres to best practices.
   - Address any feedback or suggestions from the review.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Update the build process to include the new endpoint.
   - Ensure that the build is successful and the application runs without errors.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Configure the deployment pipeline to deploy the changes to the staging environment.
   - Verify that the endpoint is accessible in the staging environment.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Set up monitoring to track the usage and performance of the new endpoint.
   - Ensure alerts are configured for any potential issues.

### Test Cases

- **Test Case 1**: Access the test endpoint via HTTP GET - Expected: Returns "Application is running".
- **Test Case 2**: Access the test endpoint with incorrect HTTP method - Expected: Returns method not allowed error.
- **Test Case 3**: Access the test endpoint with invalid URL - Expected: Returns 404 error.

### Acceptance Criteria

- The test endpoint returns a static message indicating the application is running.
- The endpoint is accessible via HTTP GET request.
- All tests pass successfully.

### Technical Requirements

- Ensure the endpoint responds within 200ms under normal load.
- Verify that the endpoint does not expose any sensitive information.
- Test the endpoint's ability to handle a minimum of 100 requests per second.

By following this step-by-step strategy, we can ensure a successful implementation of the test endpoint, meeting all the defined acceptance criteria and technical requirements.
