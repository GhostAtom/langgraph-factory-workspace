        # Project Plan: Feature: Create a Red Square

## Overview
The task is to implement a feature that displays a red square on a web page. This feature will be part of a larger UI component library and should be reusable across different parts of the application.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the repository is ready for development with the latest codebase.
   - [ ] Development environment: Set up the local development environment with necessary tools and configurations.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Install all required dependencies for the project.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Create a new component for the red square.
   - [ ] Style the component to ensure it is a perfect square with a red background.
   - [ ] Ensure the component is responsive and can be resized while maintaining its aspect ratio.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests to verify the component renders correctly and maintains its style.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Ensure the component integrates well with other UI components.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a thorough code review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Configure the build process to include the new component.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Update the deployment pipeline to deploy the changes to staging and production environments.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Set up monitoring to track the performance and usage of the new component.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Verify the component renders a red square of 100x100 pixels - Expected: The square is displayed with the correct dimensions and color.
- **Test Case 2**: Verify the component maintains its aspect ratio when resized - Expected: The square remains a square regardless of size changes.
- **Test Case 3**: Verify the component integrates with other UI components without layout issues - Expected: No layout issues occur when the component is used with other components.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The component displays a red square with dimensions of 100x100 pixels by default.
- [ ] The component is responsive and maintains its aspect ratio when resized.
- [ ] The component can be reused across different parts of the application without conflicts.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **Performance**: The component should load within 100ms.
- **Security**: Ensure no inline styles that could be exploited.
- **Scalability**: The component should be easily extendable for future enhancements.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: None identified.
- **Medium Risk**: Potential integration issues with existing components - Mitigation: Conduct thorough integration testing.
- **Low Risk**: Minor styling issues across different browsers - Mitigation: Test across major browsers.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 day - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 days - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 day - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 day - Deployment

This plan provides a structured approach to implementing the red square feature, ensuring quality and integration with existing systems.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the feature of creating a red square as part of a UI component library, we will follow a structured approach based on the provided plan. Here's a step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Clone the existing repository to your local machine.
   - Ensure you have the latest codebase by pulling the latest changes from the main branch.
   - Create a new feature branch for the red square component development.

2. **Development Environment**
   - Set up your local development environment with necessary tools such as Node.js, npm, and a code editor like VSCode.
   - Ensure your environment is configured to run React applications.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Create a New Component**
   - In the `src/components` directory, create a new file named `RedSquare.js`.
   - Define a functional React component named `RedSquare`.

2. **Style the Component**
   - Use CSS to style the component. Create a CSS file `RedSquare.css` and ensure the square is 100x100 pixels by default with a red background.
   - Import the CSS file into the `RedSquare.js` component.

3. **Ensure Responsiveness**
   - Use CSS Flexbox or Grid to ensure the component maintains its aspect ratio when resized.
   - Add props to allow dynamic resizing while maintaining the square aspect ratio.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests using a testing library like Jest and React Testing Library.
   - Verify the component renders correctly with the default size and color.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test the component within a larger UI to ensure it integrates well without layout issues.
   - Use tools like Cypress for end-to-end testing if necessary.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a code review with peers to ensure adherence to coding standards and best practices.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Update the build configuration to include the new component.
   - Run the build process to ensure there are no errors.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Update the CI/CD pipeline to deploy the changes to the staging environment.
   - Verify the component works as expected in the staging environment before deploying to production.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Set up monitoring tools to track the performance and usage of the new component in production.

### Additional Steps

- **Documentation**
  - Update the project documentation to include usage instructions for the new `RedSquare` component.
  - Ensure the documentation is clear and provides examples of how to use the component.

- **Cross-Browser Testing**
  - Test the component across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure consistent styling and functionality.

- **Commit Changes**
  - Commit your changes with descriptive messages, e.g., "Add RedSquare component with responsive styling."

By following this strategy, we ensure a thorough and structured implementation of the red square feature, meeting all the acceptance criteria and technical requirements outlined in the plan.
