        # Project Plan: Feature: Add an Endpoint to Check the Config

## Overview
The task involves creating a new API endpoint that allows users to check the current configuration settings of the application. This feature will provide a way to retrieve configuration details for debugging and verification purposes without exposing sensitive information.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the repository is up-to-date and branch is created for the feature.
   - [ ] Development environment: Confirm that the development environment is configured correctly.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Install any new dependencies required for the feature.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Create a new API endpoint `/config-check`.
   - [ ] Implement logic to retrieve and format configuration settings.
   - [ ] Ensure sensitive information is excluded from the response.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests to verify the endpoint returns the correct configuration data.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Ensure the endpoint integrates correctly with the existing system.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a thorough review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Update the build process to include the new feature.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Ensure the deployment pipeline is configured to deploy the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Implement monitoring to track the usage and performance of the new endpoint.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Request to `/config-check` with valid authentication - Expected: Returns configuration data excluding sensitive information.
- **Test Case 2**: Request to `/config-check` without authentication - Expected: Returns an authentication error.
- **Test Case 3**: Request to `/config-check` with invalid parameters - Expected: Returns a validation error.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The endpoint `/config-check` is accessible and returns the current configuration.
- [ ] Sensitive information is not exposed in the response.
- [ ] The endpoint is secured and requires authentication.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to include details about the new endpoint.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express, JWT for authentication
- **Performance**: The endpoint should respond within 200ms under normal load.
- **Security**: Ensure that the endpoint is protected against unauthorized access.
- **Scalability**: The endpoint should handle concurrent requests efficiently.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Exposing sensitive information - Mitigation: Implement strict filtering of configuration data.
- **Medium Risk**: Unauthorized access - Mitigation: Use robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Low Risk**: Performance degradation - Mitigation: Optimize the endpoint for performance and conduct load testing.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 week - Setup & Preparation, Core Development
- **Phase 2**: 1 week - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 3**: 1 week - Deployment, Monitoring setup

This plan outlines the steps necessary to successfully implement and deploy the new configuration check endpoint, ensuring it meets all functional and non-functional requirements.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the feature of adding an endpoint to check the configuration, we will follow a structured approach based on the provided plan. Here's a step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Step 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Ensure the repository is up-to-date by pulling the latest changes from the main branch.
   - Create a new feature branch for the implementation, e.g., `feature/config-check-endpoint`.

2. **Development Environment**
   - Verify that the development environment is correctly configured with Node.js and Express.
   - Ensure that the environment variables and configuration files are set up properly.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Review the current dependencies to determine if any new packages are needed.
   - Install any necessary packages, such as those for handling configuration or enhancing security.

### Step 2: Core Development

1. **Create a New API Endpoint `/config-check`**
   - Define a new route in the Express application for the `/config-check` endpoint.
   - Ensure the route is protected with JWT authentication middleware to secure access.

2. **Implement Logic to Retrieve and Format Configuration Settings**
   - Access the application's configuration settings, typically stored in environment variables or a configuration file.
   - Filter out any sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys, from the configuration data.
   - Format the remaining configuration data into a JSON response.

3. **Ensure Sensitive Information is Excluded**
   - Implement a function to sanitize the configuration data, ensuring no sensitive information is included in the response.
   - Consider using a whitelist approach to specify which configuration keys are safe to expose.

### Step 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests to verify that the `/config-check` endpoint returns the correct configuration data.
   - Test the filtering logic to ensure sensitive information is not included in the response.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Write integration tests to ensure the endpoint integrates correctly with the existing system.
   - Test the endpoint with valid and invalid authentication tokens to verify security.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a thorough code review to ensure adherence to coding standards and best practices.
   - Address any feedback or issues identified during the review process.

### Step 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Update the build process to include the new feature, ensuring all dependencies and configurations are correctly set.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Configure the deployment pipeline to deploy the new endpoint to the staging environment for testing.
   - Once verified, deploy the endpoint to the production environment.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement monitoring to track the usage and performance of the new endpoint.
   - Set up alerts for any unusual activity or performance issues.

### Step 5: Documentation

1. **Update Documentation**
   - Update the API documentation to include details about the new `/config-check` endpoint.
   - Provide information on how to authenticate and what data is returned.

### Step 6: Validation

1. **Acceptance Criteria Verification**
   - Verify that all acceptance criteria are met, including security, performance, and documentation requirements.
   - Conduct a final review to ensure the feature is ready for release.

By following this strategy, we can ensure a smooth implementation of the new configuration check endpoint, meeting all functional and non-functional requirements.
