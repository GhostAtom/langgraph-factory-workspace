        # Project Plan: Add Health Check Endpoint

## Overview
The task involves adding a health check endpoint to the existing application. This endpoint will provide a simple way to verify that the application is running and responsive. It will be used by monitoring tools to ensure the application is healthy and to trigger alerts if it becomes unresponsive.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the latest code is pulled and a new branch is created for the feature.
   - [ ] Development environment: Confirm the development environment is configured correctly.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Verify all necessary dependencies are installed and up to date.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Define the health check endpoint route and method (e.g., GET /health).
   - [ ] Implement the logic to check the application's health (e.g., database connection, service availability).
   - [ ] Return appropriate HTTP status codes and messages based on the health check results.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests to cover the health check logic and endpoint response.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Ensure the endpoint works correctly within the application context.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a peer review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Update the build process to include the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Ensure the deployment pipeline is configured to deploy the changes.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Configure monitoring tools to use the new health check endpoint.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Health check endpoint returns 200 OK when the application is healthy - Expected: HTTP 200 OK
- **Test Case 2**: Health check endpoint returns 500 Internal Server Error when the application is unhealthy - Expected: HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
- **Test Case 3**: Health check endpoint returns appropriate error message when a specific service is down - Expected: Error message indicating the service issue

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Health check endpoint is accessible and returns the correct status code.
- [ ] Health check logic accurately reflects the application's health.
- [ ] Monitoring tools are configured to use the health check endpoint.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express (or relevant framework), Monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)
- **Performance**: The health check should respond within 100ms under normal conditions.
- **Security**: Ensure the endpoint is protected from unauthorized access if necessary.
- **Scalability**: The endpoint should handle multiple requests without degrading performance.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Misconfiguration of monitoring tools leading to false alerts - Mitigation: Thorough testing and validation of monitoring setup.
- **Medium Risk**: Endpoint exposure leading to potential security vulnerabilities - Mitigation: Implement access controls and rate limiting.
- **Low Risk**: Minor performance impact due to additional endpoint - Mitigation: Optimize endpoint logic and monitor performance.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 week - Setup & Preparation, Core Development
- **Phase 2**: 1 week - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 3**: 1 week - Deployment, Monitoring setup

This plan provides a structured approach to adding a health check endpoint, ensuring it is implemented efficiently and effectively, with minimal risk to the existing application.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the health check endpoint as outlined in the project plan, we will follow a structured approach. Here is a step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Step 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Pull the latest code from the main branch to ensure you have the most recent version of the application.
   - Create a new feature branch for the health check endpoint, e.g., `feature/health-check-endpoint`.

2. **Development Environment**
   - Verify that your development environment is correctly configured for Node.js and Express.
   - Ensure you have access to any necessary services (e.g., databases) for testing the health check.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Check the `package.json` for any missing dependencies and install them using `npm install`.
   - Update any outdated dependencies if necessary to ensure compatibility and security.

### Step 2: Core Development

1. **Define the Health Check Endpoint**
   - In your Express application, define a new route for the health check endpoint, e.g., `GET /health`.

2. **Implement Health Check Logic**
   - Create a function to check the application's health. This should include:
     - Verifying database connectivity.
     - Checking the availability of essential services.
     - Any other critical checks specific to your application.

3. **Return Appropriate HTTP Status Codes**
   - Implement logic to return `HTTP 200 OK` if all checks pass.
   - Return `HTTP 500 Internal Server Error` if any check fails, along with a descriptive error message.

### Step 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests for the health check logic to ensure it correctly identifies healthy and unhealthy states.
   - Use a testing framework like Mocha or Jest for Node.js.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test the health check endpoint within the context of the entire application to ensure it behaves as expected.
   - Simulate different scenarios, such as database downtime, to test the endpoint's response.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a peer review of the code to ensure it meets quality standards and follows best practices.
   - Address any feedback or requested changes from the review.

### Step 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Update any build scripts or configurations to include the new endpoint.
   - Ensure the application builds successfully with the new changes.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Configure the deployment pipeline to deploy the changes to staging and production environments.
   - Verify that the pipeline includes steps for testing and validation.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Configure monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to use the new health check endpoint.
   - Test the monitoring setup to ensure it triggers alerts appropriately based on the endpoint's status.

### Step 5: Documentation & Finalization

1. **Documentation**
   - Update the application's documentation to include information about the new health check endpoint.
   - Document any configuration changes required for monitoring tools.

2. **Final Validation**
   - Ensure all acceptance criteria are met, including endpoint accessibility and accurate health reflection.
   - Perform a final review to confirm all tasks are complete and the endpoint is ready for production.

3. **Commit and Push Changes**
   - Commit the changes with a descriptive message, e.g., "Add health check endpoint for application monitoring."
   - Push the feature branch to the remote repository and create a pull request for merging into the main branch.

By following this strategy, we ensure a thorough and efficient implementation of the health check endpoint, meeting all project requirements and minimizing risks.
