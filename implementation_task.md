        # Project Plan: Add a /health Endpoint

## Overview
The task involves adding a new `/health` endpoint to the existing application. This endpoint will provide a simple health check for the application, indicating whether the application is running and operational. This is crucial for monitoring and ensuring the application is functioning correctly.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the repository is up-to-date and branch is created for the feature.
   - [ ] Development environment: Confirm the development environment is configured correctly.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Verify all necessary dependencies are installed.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Define the `/health` endpoint in the application.
   - [ ] Implement logic to check the application's health status.
   - [ ] Return appropriate HTTP status codes and messages.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests to verify the endpoint returns the correct status.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Ensure the endpoint integrates well with the existing system.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a thorough review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Ensure the application builds successfully with the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Update the deployment pipeline to include the new feature.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Configure monitoring to track the health endpoint's status.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Access the `/health` endpoint when the application is running - Expected: HTTP 200 OK with a message "Service is healthy".
- **Test Case 2**: Access the `/health` endpoint when the application is down - Expected: HTTP 503 Service Unavailable.
- **Test Case 3**: Validate the response time of the `/health` endpoint - Expected: Response time < 200ms.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The `/health` endpoint returns HTTP 200 when the application is healthy.
- [ ] The `/health` endpoint returns HTTP 503 when the application is not healthy.
- [ ] The endpoint is documented and included in the API documentation.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express.js (or relevant framework)
- **Performance**: The endpoint should respond within 200ms.
- **Security**: Ensure the endpoint does not expose sensitive information.
- **Scalability**: The endpoint should handle a high number of requests without degradation.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: None identified.
- **Medium Risk**: Potential for incorrect health status reporting - Mitigation: Thorough testing and monitoring.
- **Low Risk**: Minor performance impact - Mitigation: Optimize endpoint logic and monitor performance.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 day - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 days - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 day - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 day - Deployment

This plan provides a structured approach to implementing the `/health` endpoint, ensuring it is delivered efficiently and meets all necessary requirements.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the `/health` endpoint as outlined in the project plan, we will follow a structured approach. Here's a step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Pull the latest changes from the main branch to ensure the repository is up-to-date.
   - Create a new feature branch for the `/health` endpoint, e.g., `feature/add-health-endpoint`.

2. **Development Environment**
   - Verify that the development environment is correctly configured with Node.js and Express.js.
   - Ensure that the application runs without errors in the current setup.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Check if any additional dependencies are required for health checks (e.g., monitoring tools).
   - Install any necessary dependencies using `npm install`.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Define the `/health` Endpoint**
   - Open the main application file (e.g., `app.js` or `server.js`).
   - Define a new route for `/health` using Express.js.

2. **Implement Health Check Logic**
   - Implement logic to determine the application's health status. This could include checking database connectivity, service availability, etc.
   - Ensure the logic is efficient and does not significantly impact performance.

3. **Return Appropriate HTTP Status Codes and Messages**
   - If the application is healthy, return HTTP 200 with a message like "Service is healthy".
   - If the application is not healthy, return HTTP 503 with a message like "Service is unavailable".

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests to verify that the `/health` endpoint returns the correct status and message.
   - Use a testing framework like Mocha or Jest for writing tests.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Ensure the `/health` endpoint integrates well with the existing system.
   - Test the endpoint in a staging environment to simulate real-world conditions.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a thorough code review to ensure adherence to coding standards and best practices.
   - Address any feedback or issues identified during the review.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Ensure the application builds successfully with the new `/health` endpoint.
   - Run any build scripts or processes required for deployment.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Update the deployment pipeline to include the new feature.
   - Deploy the changes to a staging environment for final testing.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Configure monitoring tools to track the status of the `/health` endpoint.
   - Set up alerts for any issues detected with the endpoint.

### Documentation

- Update the API documentation to include details about the `/health` endpoint.
- Ensure the documentation covers the expected responses and any relevant technical details.

### Final Steps

- Verify that all acceptance criteria are met.
- Ensure all tests are passing and the code is reviewed and approved.
- Deploy the changes to production once everything is validated in staging.

By following this strategy, we can efficiently implement the `/health` endpoint while ensuring it meets all requirements and maintains high quality.
