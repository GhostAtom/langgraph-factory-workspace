        # Project Plan: Add a Simple Health Check Endpoint

## Overview
The objective of this project is to implement a simple health check endpoint in the existing application. This endpoint will provide a quick way to verify that the application is running and responsive. It will return a basic status message indicating the health of the application.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the latest code is pulled from the main branch.
   - [ ] Development environment: Confirm the local development environment is configured correctly.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Verify all necessary dependencies are installed and up to date.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Create a new endpoint `/health` in the application.
   - [ ] Implement logic to return a JSON response with a status message (e.g., `{ "status": "healthy" }`).
   - [ ] Ensure the endpoint is accessible and does not require authentication.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests to verify the endpoint returns the correct status message.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Ensure the endpoint is correctly integrated into the application and accessible.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a peer review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Ensure the application builds successfully with the new changes.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Update the CI/CD pipeline to include the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Add monitoring for the health check endpoint to track uptime and response times.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Access the `/health` endpoint - Expected: Returns `{ "status": "healthy" }` with HTTP status 200.
- **Test Case 2**: Access the `/health` endpoint when the application is down - Expected: Returns an error message with HTTP status 503.
- **Test Case 3**: Verify the endpoint does not require authentication - Expected: Accessible without authentication headers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The `/health` endpoint returns a JSON response with a status message.
- [ ] The endpoint is accessible without authentication.
- [ ] The endpoint is monitored for uptime and response time.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express (or relevant framework)
- **Performance**: The endpoint should respond within 100ms under normal load.
- **Security**: Ensure the endpoint does not expose sensitive information.
- **Scalability**: The endpoint should handle a high number of requests without degradation.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: None identified.
- **Medium Risk**: Potential for the endpoint to be used for DDoS attacks. Mitigation: Implement rate limiting.
- **Low Risk**: Minor risk of incorrect status reporting. Mitigation: Regularly test and monitor the endpoint.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 day - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 days - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 day - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 day - Deployment

This plan provides a structured approach to adding a health check endpoint, ensuring it is implemented efficiently and effectively.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the health check endpoint as outlined in the project plan, we will follow a structured approach, breaking down the tasks into manageable steps. Here's a detailed implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Clone the repository if not already done: `git clone <repository-url>`
   - Navigate to the project directory: `cd <project-directory>`
   - Pull the latest code from the main branch: `git pull origin main`

2. **Development Environment**
   - Ensure Node.js and npm are installed and up to date.
   - Verify the local development environment is configured correctly by running the application: `npm start` or `node app.js`

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Check for any missing dependencies and install them: `npm install`
   - Update any outdated dependencies if necessary: `npm update`

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Create the `/health` Endpoint**
   - Open the main application file (e.g., `app.js` or `server.js`).
   - Import the necessary modules (e.g., Express).
   - Define a new route for the `/health` endpoint:
     ```javascript
     app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
       res.status(200).json({ status: 'healthy' });
     });
     ```
   - Ensure the endpoint is accessible without authentication by not including any middleware that requires authentication.

2. **Implement Logic**
   - The logic for the endpoint is simple, returning a JSON response with a status message.
   - Ensure the response is sent with an HTTP status code of 200.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests to verify the `/health` endpoint returns the correct status message.
   - Use a testing framework like Mocha or Jest.
   - Example test case:
     ```javascript
     it('should return status healthy', async () => {
       const response = await request(app).get('/health');
       expect(response.status).toBe(200);
       expect(response.body).toEqual({ status: 'healthy' });
     });
     ```

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Ensure the endpoint is correctly integrated into the application and accessible.
   - Test the endpoint without authentication headers to verify accessibility.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a peer review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.
   - Address any feedback or requested changes.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Ensure the application builds successfully with the new changes.
   - Run any build scripts if necessary: `npm run build`

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Update the CI/CD pipeline to include the new endpoint.
   - Ensure automated tests are included in the pipeline.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Add monitoring for the health check endpoint to track uptime and response times.
   - Use tools like New Relic or Datadog for monitoring.

### Final Steps

- **Documentation**
  - Update the project documentation to include details about the new `/health` endpoint.
  - Document the purpose, expected response, and any relevant technical details.

- **Commit Changes**
  - Commit the changes with a descriptive message: `git commit -m "Add health check endpoint"`
  - Push the changes to the repository: `git push origin <branch-name>`

- **Deployment to Staging/Production**
  - Deploy the changes to the staging environment for further testing.
  - Once validated, deploy to the production environment.

By following this step-by-step strategy, we ensure a thorough and efficient implementation of the health check endpoint, meeting all the acceptance criteria and technical requirements outlined in the plan.
