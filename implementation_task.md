        # Project Plan: Add Health Check Endpoint

## Overview
The task involves adding a health check endpoint to the existing application. This endpoint will provide a simple way to verify that the application is running and responsive. It will return a status indicating the health of the application, which can be used by monitoring tools to ensure the application is functioning correctly.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the latest code is pulled from the main branch.
   - [ ] Development environment: Confirm the local development environment is configured correctly.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Install any new dependencies required for the health check endpoint.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Define the health check endpoint route.
   - [ ] Implement the logic to check the application's health status.
   - [ ] Return appropriate HTTP status codes and messages (e.g., 200 OK for healthy, 503 Service Unavailable for unhealthy).

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests to verify the health check endpoint returns the correct status.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Ensure the endpoint works correctly within the application context.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a peer review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Update the build process to include the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Ensure the endpoint is included in the deployment pipeline.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Configure monitoring tools to use the health check endpoint.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Health check endpoint returns 200 OK when the application is healthy - Expected: 200 OK
- **Test Case 2**: Health check endpoint returns 503 Service Unavailable when the application is unhealthy - Expected: 503 Service Unavailable
- **Test Case 3**: Health check endpoint returns a JSON response with a status message - Expected: JSON response with "status": "healthy" or "unhealthy"

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The health check endpoint is accessible via a defined route.
- [ ] The endpoint returns a 200 OK status when the application is healthy.
- [ ] The endpoint returns a 503 Service Unavailable status when the application is unhealthy.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express (or relevant framework)
- **Performance**: The endpoint should respond within 100ms under normal conditions.
- **Security**: Ensure the endpoint does not expose sensitive information.
- **Scalability**: The endpoint should handle multiple concurrent requests without degradation.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Misconfiguration of the endpoint leading to false positives/negatives - Mitigation: Thorough testing and validation.
- **Medium Risk**: Performance impact due to additional checks - Mitigation: Optimize the health check logic.
- **Low Risk**: Endpoint exposure to unauthorized users - Mitigation: Implement access controls if necessary.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 day - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 days - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 day - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 day - Deployment

This plan provides a structured approach to adding a health check endpoint, ensuring it is implemented efficiently and effectively.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the health check endpoint as outlined in the project plan, we will follow a structured approach. Here's a step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Pull the latest code from the main branch to ensure you are working with the most recent version of the application.
   - Command: `git pull origin main`

2. **Development Environment**
   - Verify that your local development environment is correctly configured to run the application.
   - Ensure Node.js and any necessary tools (e.g., npm or yarn) are installed and up-to-date.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Check if any new dependencies are required for implementing the health check endpoint. For a basic health check, no additional dependencies might be needed, but confirm based on the application context.
   - Command: `npm install` or `yarn install` to ensure all current dependencies are installed.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Define the Health Check Endpoint Route**
   - In your Express application, define a new route for the health check endpoint. Typically, this could be `/health` or `/healthcheck`.

2. **Implement the Logic to Check Application's Health Status**
   - Create a function that checks the application's health. This could be as simple as returning a status of "healthy" if the server is running, or more complex if it involves checking database connections or other services.

3. **Return Appropriate HTTP Status Codes and Messages**
   - Implement logic to return a `200 OK` status with a JSON response indicating "healthy" when the application is running correctly.
   - If the application is unhealthy (e.g., a critical service is down), return a `503 Service Unavailable` status with a JSON response indicating "unhealthy".

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests to verify that the health check endpoint returns the correct status and message.
   - Use a testing framework like Mocha, Jest, or similar to implement these tests.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Ensure the endpoint works correctly within the application context by writing integration tests.
   - Test the endpoint's response under different scenarios (e.g., normal operation, simulated service failure).

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a peer review of the implemented code to ensure it meets quality standards and adheres to best practices.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Update the build process to include the new endpoint. This might involve updating build scripts or configuration files.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Ensure the health check endpoint is included in the deployment pipeline. This might involve updating CI/CD configurations.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Configure monitoring tools to use the health check endpoint. This could involve setting up alerts for when the endpoint returns an unhealthy status.

### Additional Considerations

- **Documentation**
  - Update the application documentation to include information about the new health check endpoint, its purpose, and how to use it.

- **Security**
  - Ensure the endpoint does not expose sensitive information. Consider implementing access controls if necessary.

- **Performance**
  - Optimize the health check logic to ensure it responds within 100ms under normal conditions.

By following this strategy, we can efficiently implement the health check endpoint while ensuring it meets all the acceptance criteria and technical requirements outlined in the project plan.
