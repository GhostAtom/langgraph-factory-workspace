   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the project repository is up-to-date and accessible.
   - [ ] Development environment: Configure the development environment with necessary tools and access.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Install any required libraries or frameworks.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Create a CSS class for red text: Define a CSS class that applies a red color to text elements.
   - [ ] Update HTML elements: Modify the HTML to include the new CSS class where red text is needed.
   - [ ] Ensure accessibility: Verify that the red text meets accessibility standards (e.g., contrast ratio).

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests to ensure the CSS class is applied correctly.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Test the feature in the context of the entire application to ensure it works as expected.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a peer review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Integrate the changes into the build process.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Update the deployment pipeline to include the new feature.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Implement monitoring to track the feature's performance and any potential issues.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Apply the red text class to a paragraph element - Expected: The paragraph text appears in red.
- **Test Case 2**: Apply the red text class to a heading element - Expected: The heading text appears in red.
- **Test Case 3**: Verify contrast ratio for accessibility - Expected: The red text meets the required contrast ratio for accessibility.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The red text class is correctly applied to specified elements.
- [ ] The feature meets accessibility standards.
- [ ] The feature is integrated without breaking existing functionality.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Performance**: The feature should not degrade page load times.
- **Security**: Ensure no security vulnerabilities are introduced.
- **Scalability**: The feature should be easily extendable to other text elements.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: None identified.
- **Medium Risk**: Potential for CSS conflicts - Mitigation: Thorough testing and code review.
- **Low Risk**: Minor visual inconsistencies - Mitigation: Visual testing across different browsers.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 day - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 days - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 day - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 day - Deployment

This plan outlines the steps necessary to implement the feature of adding red text, ensuring it is done efficiently and effectively while maintaining quality and performance standards.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the feature of adding a basic red text to a web page, we will follow the outlined project plan. Here is a step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Ensure the project repository is up-to-date by pulling the latest changes from the main branch.
   - If the repository is not cloned locally, clone it using Git.

2. **Development Environment**
   - Verify that the development environment is configured with the necessary tools, such as a code editor (e.g., VSCode), Git, and a local server setup (e.g., Live Server for HTML/CSS).

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Check for any required libraries or frameworks that need to be installed. For this task, ensure that the environment supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Create a CSS Class for Red Text**
   - Define a CSS class in the stylesheet to apply a red color to text elements. This can be done by adding the following CSS rule:
     ```css
     .red-text {
         color: red;
     }
     ```

2. **Update HTML Elements**
   - Modify the HTML files to include the new CSS class where red text is needed. For example:
     ```html
     <p class="red-text">This is a paragraph with red text.</p>
     <h1 class="red-text">This is a heading with red text.</h1>
     ```

3. **Ensure Accessibility**
   - Verify that the red text meets accessibility standards, particularly the contrast ratio. Use tools like the WebAIM Contrast Checker to ensure compliance.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests to ensure the CSS class is applied correctly. This can be done using a testing framework like Jest with a library like jsdom to simulate the DOM.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test the feature in the context of the entire application to ensure it works as expected. This involves loading the web page and visually verifying the red text.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a peer review of the code to ensure quality and adherence to standards. This includes checking for CSS conflicts and ensuring the code is clean and maintainable.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Integrate the changes into the build process. If using a build tool like Webpack, ensure the CSS is included in the final build.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Update the deployment pipeline to include the new feature. This may involve updating CI/CD configurations to deploy the changes to staging/production environments.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement monitoring to track the feature's performance and any potential issues. This can be done using tools like Google Analytics or a custom logging solution.

### Test Cases

- **Test Case 1**: Apply the red text class to a paragraph element and verify it appears in red.
- **Test Case 2**: Apply the red text class to a heading element and verify it appears in red.
- **Test Case 3**: Verify the contrast ratio for accessibility compliance.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Ensure the red text class is correctly applied to specified elements.
- Verify the feature meets accessibility standards.
- Confirm the feature is integrated without breaking existing functionality.

### Final Steps

- Commit the changes with a descriptive message, such as "Add red text feature with accessibility compliance."
- Push the changes to the repository and create a pull request for review.
- Once approved, merge the changes into the main branch and deploy to the production environment.

By following this strategy, we ensure a structured and efficient implementation of the red text feature, maintaining quality and performance standards.
