        # Project Plan: Add a /health Endpoint

## Overview
The task involves adding a new `/health` endpoint to the existing application. This endpoint will provide a simple health check mechanism to ensure that the application is running and responsive. It will return a status indicating the health of the application, which can be used by monitoring tools to track the application's availability.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the repository is up-to-date with the latest code.
   - [ ] Development environment: Set up the local development environment.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Install any new dependencies required for the health check endpoint.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Define the `/health` endpoint in the application router.
   - [ ] Implement the logic to check the application's health status.
   - [ ] Return a JSON response with the health status and any relevant metadata.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write unit tests to verify the functionality of the `/health` endpoint.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Ensure the endpoint integrates correctly with the rest of the application.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a code review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Ensure the build process includes the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Update the deployment pipeline to include the new changes.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Configure monitoring tools to use the `/health` endpoint for health checks.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Access the `/health` endpoint when the application is running - Expected: Status 200 with a "healthy" message.
- **Test Case 2**: Access the `/health` endpoint when a critical service is down - Expected: Status 503 with a "service unavailable" message.
- **Test Case 3**: Access the `/health` endpoint with invalid parameters - Expected: Status 400 with an "invalid request" message.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The `/health` endpoint returns a 200 status code when the application is healthy.
- [ ] The endpoint provides a clear message indicating the application's health status.
- [ ] The endpoint is accessible and responds within acceptable time limits.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express.js (or relevant framework)
- **Performance**: The endpoint should respond within 100ms under normal load.
- **Security**: Ensure the endpoint does not expose sensitive information.
- **Scalability**: The endpoint should handle concurrent requests efficiently.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Misconfiguration of the endpoint leading to false health status - Mitigation: Thorough testing and validation.
- **Medium Risk**: Performance degradation under high load - Mitigation: Load testing and optimization.
- **Low Risk**: Minor bugs in the endpoint logic - Mitigation: Code review and unit testing.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 day - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 days - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 day - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 day - Deployment

This plan provides a structured approach to adding a `/health` endpoint, ensuring that all aspects of development, testing, and deployment are covered. The focus is on delivering a reliable and efficient health check mechanism for the application.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the `/health` endpoint as outlined in the project plan, we will follow a structured approach. Here's a step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Pull the latest changes from the main branch of the repository to ensure your local environment is up-to-date.
   - Create a new feature branch for the `/health` endpoint implementation.

2. **Development Environment**
   - Ensure your local development environment is set up with Node.js and Express.js (or the relevant framework) installed.
   - Verify that the application runs successfully in your local environment.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Review the current dependencies to determine if any new packages are needed for the health check endpoint. Typically, no new dependencies are required for a basic health check.

### Phase 2: Core Development

4. **Define the `/health` Endpoint**
   - Open the application router file (e.g., `app.js` or `routes.js`).
   - Add a new route for the `/health` endpoint.

5. **Implement Health Check Logic**
   - Create a controller function that checks the application's health status. This can be as simple as returning a "healthy" status if the server is running.
   - Consider adding checks for critical services (e.g., database connectivity) if applicable.

6. **Return JSON Response**
   - Ensure the endpoint returns a JSON response with a status code and a message indicating the health status.
   - Example response: `{ "status": "healthy", "timestamp": "2023-10-01T12:00:00Z" }`

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

7. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests for the `/health` endpoint to verify it returns the correct status and message.
   - Use a testing framework like Mocha or Jest for Node.js applications.

8. **Integration Tests**
   - Ensure the `/health` endpoint integrates correctly with the rest of the application.
   - Test scenarios where critical services are down to ensure the endpoint returns the appropriate status.

9. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a code review with peers to ensure the implementation meets coding standards and best practices.

### Phase 4: Deployment

10. **Build Process**
    - Verify that the build process includes the new endpoint and that there are no build errors.

11. **Deployment Pipeline**
    - Update the deployment pipeline to include the changes for the `/health` endpoint.
    - Deploy the changes to a staging environment for further testing.

12. **Monitoring Setup**
    - Configure monitoring tools to use the `/health` endpoint for health checks.
    - Ensure alerts are set up for any status other than "healthy."

### Additional Considerations

- **Documentation**
  - Update the application documentation to include details about the `/health` endpoint, its purpose, and how to use it.

- **Performance Testing**
  - Conduct load testing to ensure the endpoint responds within the specified performance criteria (100ms under normal load).

- **Security**
  - Review the endpoint to ensure it does not expose any sensitive information.

### Final Steps

- **Acceptance Criteria Verification**
  - Verify that all acceptance criteria are met, including response time and message clarity.

- **Deployment to Production**
  - Once all tests pass and the code is reviewed, deploy the changes to the production environment.

- **Post-Deployment Monitoring**
  - Monitor the `/health` endpoint in production to ensure it functions as expected and provides accurate health status.

By following this step-by-step strategy, we can ensure a successful implementation of the `/health` endpoint, meeting all the requirements and acceptance criteria outlined in the project plan.
