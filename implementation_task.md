        # Project Plan: Create Azure Resource Group for MVP

## Overview
The task involves setting up an Azure Resource Group to support the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) deployment. This includes configuring the necessary resources and ensuring that the environment is ready for development and testing.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts
   - [ ] Development environment configured with Azure CLI and necessary tools
   - [ ] Dependencies installation, including Terraform or ARM templates

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Define the Azure Resource Group configuration
   - [ ] Create IaC scripts for resource group creation
   - [ ] Implement scripts to configure network settings and security groups

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests for IaC scripts
   - [ ] Integration tests to ensure resources are correctly provisioned
   - [ ] Code review to ensure best practices and security compliance

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process for IaC scripts
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline setup using Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions
   - [ ] Monitoring setup for resource group health and performance

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Verify Resource Group creation - Expected: Resource Group is created in the specified Azure region.
- **Test Case 2**: Validate network configuration - Expected: Network settings are correctly applied and secure.
- **Test Case 3**: Check deployment pipeline - Expected: Automated deployment pipeline successfully provisions resources.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Resource Group is created in the correct Azure region
- [ ] Network and security configurations are applied as per specifications
- [ ] Deployment pipeline is functional and automated

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Azure, Azure CLI, Terraform/ARM Templates, Azure DevOps/GitHub Actions
- **Performance**: Resources should be provisioned within 5 minutes
- **Security**: Ensure all resources comply with organizational security policies
- **Scalability**: Resource Group should support scaling of resources as needed

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Misconfiguration of network/security settings - Mitigation: Conduct thorough reviews and testing
- **Medium Risk**: Delays in deployment pipeline setup - Mitigation: Allocate additional resources for setup
- **Low Risk**: Minor bugs in IaC scripts - Mitigation: Implement comprehensive testing

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 week - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 weeks - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 week - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 week - Deployment

This plan provides a structured approach to creating an Azure Resource Group for the MVP, ensuring that all necessary steps are taken to deliver a secure and scalable environment.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the project plan for creating an Azure Resource Group for the MVP, we will follow a structured approach, breaking down the tasks into manageable steps. Here's a detailed implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Scripts**
   - Create a new GitHub repository for the project.
   - Set up the repository structure to organize IaC scripts, documentation, and configuration files.

2. **Development Environment Configuration**
   - Install and configure Azure CLI on your local development environment.
   - Ensure you have access to the Azure subscription where the resources will be created.
   - Install necessary tools like Terraform or set up ARM templates for resource management.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - If using Terraform, install the latest version and configure it with your Azure credentials.
   - If using ARM templates, ensure you have the necessary JSON templates and tools for deployment.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Define the Azure Resource Group Configuration**
   - Determine the Azure region and naming conventions for the Resource Group.
   - Document the configuration details for reference.

2. **Create IaC Scripts for Resource Group Creation**
   - Use Cursor AI to generate Terraform scripts or ARM templates to define the Resource Group.
   - Ensure the scripts include parameters for region, tags, and any other necessary metadata.

3. **Implement Scripts to Configure Network Settings and Security Groups**
   - Define network configurations such as Virtual Networks (VNets), Subnets, and Network Security Groups (NSGs).
   - Implement security rules to ensure compliance with organizational policies.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests for IaC Scripts**
   - Write unit tests to validate the syntax and logic of the IaC scripts.
   - Use tools like `terraform validate` or ARM template validation commands.

2. **Integration Tests for Resource Provisioning**
   - Deploy the scripts in a test environment to ensure resources are provisioned correctly.
   - Verify that the Resource Group and associated resources are created as expected.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a thorough code review to ensure best practices are followed.
   - Check for security compliance and adherence to organizational standards.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process for IaC Scripts**
   - Set up a build process to package and prepare the IaC scripts for deployment.
   - Use tools like Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions to automate the build process.

2. **Deployment Pipeline Setup**
   - Configure a deployment pipeline using Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.
   - Automate the deployment of the Resource Group and associated resources.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement monitoring tools to track the health and performance of the Resource Group.
   - Set up alerts for any anomalies or issues in the environment.

### Testing and Validation

- **Test Case 1**: Verify Resource Group creation in the specified Azure region.
- **Test Case 2**: Validate network configuration and security settings.
- **Test Case 3**: Check the functionality of the automated deployment pipeline.

### Documentation

- Update the project documentation to include setup instructions, configuration details, and usage guidelines.
- Document the testing process and results for future reference.

### Final Steps

- Ensure all acceptance criteria are met.
- Conduct a final review and approval process.
- Deploy the solution to the staging/production environment.

By following this step-by-step implementation strategy, we can ensure a successful setup of the Azure Resource Group for the MVP, meeting all technical and business requirements.
