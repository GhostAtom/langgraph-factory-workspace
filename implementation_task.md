        # Project Plan: Feature - Create an Endpoint to Delete the Config

## Overview
The task involves developing a new API endpoint that allows users to delete a specific configuration from the system. This feature is crucial for maintaining system flexibility and ensuring that outdated or incorrect configurations can be removed efficiently.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the repository is up-to-date with the latest codebase.
   - [ ] Development environment: Configure the local development environment to support API development.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Install necessary libraries and dependencies for API development.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Define API endpoint: Design the endpoint URL and HTTP method (DELETE).
   - [ ] Implement endpoint logic: Write the server-side logic to handle the deletion of configurations.
   - [ ] Error handling: Implement error handling for cases such as non-existent configurations or unauthorized access.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write unit tests to verify the endpoint logic and error handling.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Develop integration tests to ensure the endpoint works correctly with other system components.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a thorough code review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Ensure the build process includes the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Update the deployment pipeline to include the new feature.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Implement monitoring to track the usage and performance of the new endpoint.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Delete an existing configuration - Expected: Configuration is successfully deleted.
- **Test Case 2**: Attempt to delete a non-existent configuration - Expected: Appropriate error message is returned.
- **Test Case 3**: Unauthorized deletion attempt - Expected: Access denied error is returned.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The endpoint allows deletion of configurations by ID.
- [ ] Proper error messages are returned for invalid requests.
- [ ] The endpoint is secure and only accessible to authorized users.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- **Performance**: The endpoint should handle up to 100 requests per second.
- **Security**: Implement authentication and authorization checks.
- **Scalability**: Ensure the endpoint can scale horizontally with the application.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Unauthorized access to the endpoint - Mitigation: Implement robust authentication and authorization.
- **Medium Risk**: Data loss due to accidental deletion - Mitigation: Implement a confirmation step or soft delete mechanism.
- **Low Risk**: Performance degradation - Mitigation: Optimize database queries and endpoint logic.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 week - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 weeks - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 week - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 week - Deployment

This plan outlines the steps necessary to successfully implement and deploy the new endpoint for deleting configurations, ensuring it meets all technical and business requirements.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the feature of creating an endpoint to delete a configuration, we will follow the outlined project plan and break it down into detailed steps. Here's a step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Pull the latest changes from the main branch of the repository to ensure your local environment is up-to-date.
   - Create a new feature branch for the implementation, e.g., `feature/delete-config-endpoint`.

2. **Development Environment**
   - Ensure your local development environment is configured for Node.js and Express.js development.
   - Verify that MongoDB is running locally or accessible for development purposes.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Check the `package.json` file for any missing dependencies related to API development.
   - Install any necessary libraries, such as `express`, `mongoose` (for MongoDB), and `jsonwebtoken` (for authentication).

### Phase 2: Core Development

4. **Define API Endpoint**
   - Design the endpoint URL and HTTP method. For example, use `DELETE /api/configs/:id` where `:id` is the configuration ID.

5. **Implement Endpoint Logic**
   - Create a new route handler in your Express application for the DELETE request.
   - Use Mongoose to interact with the MongoDB database and delete the specified configuration by ID.
   - Implement logic to check if the configuration exists before attempting deletion.

6. **Error Handling**
   - Implement error handling for scenarios such as:
     - Configuration not found: Return a 404 status with an appropriate message.
     - Unauthorized access: Return a 403 status if the user is not authorized to delete the configuration.
     - Database errors: Handle any potential database errors gracefully.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

7. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests for the endpoint logic using a testing framework like Mocha or Jest.
   - Test cases should cover successful deletion, non-existent configuration, and unauthorized access.

8. **Integration Tests**
   - Develop integration tests to ensure the endpoint interacts correctly with other system components.
   - Use a tool like Supertest to simulate HTTP requests to the endpoint.

9. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a code review with peers to ensure the code adheres to best practices and meets quality standards.

### Phase 4: Deployment

10. **Build Process**
    - Ensure the build process includes the new endpoint by updating any necessary build scripts or configurations.

11. **Deployment Pipeline**
    - Update the deployment pipeline to include the new feature, ensuring it is deployed to staging for testing before production.

12. **Monitoring Setup**
    - Implement monitoring to track the usage and performance of the new endpoint.
    - Use tools like New Relic or Datadog to monitor API performance and error rates.

### Additional Considerations

- **Security**
  - Implement authentication and authorization checks using middleware to ensure only authorized users can delete configurations.
  - Consider using JWT for token-based authentication.

- **Scalability**
  - Ensure the endpoint can handle the expected load by optimizing database queries and using efficient coding practices.

- **Documentation**
  - Update API documentation to include details about the new endpoint, including request parameters, response formats, and error messages.

- **Risk Mitigation**
  - Consider implementing a soft delete mechanism or a confirmation step to mitigate the risk of accidental data loss.

By following these steps, we can ensure a successful implementation of the new endpoint for deleting configurations, meeting all technical and business requirements.
