        # Project Plan: Add Health Check Endpoint

## Overview
The objective of this project is to implement a health check endpoint in our application. This endpoint will provide a simple way to verify that the application is running and responsive. It will be used by monitoring tools to ensure the application is healthy and to trigger alerts if it is not.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the repository is up-to-date and branch is created for the feature.
   - [ ] Development environment: Confirm that the local development environment is configured correctly.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Verify that all necessary dependencies for the health check are installed.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Define the health check endpoint route and method (e.g., GET /health).
   - [ ] Implement the logic to check the application's health status (e.g., database connection, service availability).
   - [ ] Return appropriate HTTP status codes and messages based on the health status.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests to cover the health check logic.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Ensure the endpoint works correctly within the application.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a peer review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Integrate the health check endpoint into the build process.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Update the deployment pipeline to include the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Configure monitoring tools to use the health check endpoint for application health verification.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Health check endpoint returns 200 OK when the application is healthy - Expected: HTTP 200 OK
- **Test Case 2**: Health check endpoint returns 500 Internal Server Error when the application is unhealthy - Expected: HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
- **Test Case 3**: Health check endpoint returns appropriate error message when a specific service is down - Expected: Error message indicating the service issue

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The health check endpoint is accessible and returns the correct status code.
- [ ] The endpoint accurately reflects the application's health status.
- [ ] Monitoring tools are configured to use the health check endpoint.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express (or relevant framework), Monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)
- **Performance**: The health check should respond within 100ms under normal conditions.
- **Security**: Ensure the endpoint is protected from unauthorized access if necessary.
- **Scalability**: The endpoint should handle multiple requests without performance degradation.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Misconfiguration of monitoring tools leading to false alerts - Mitigation: Thorough testing and validation of monitoring setup.
- **Medium Risk**: Endpoint exposure leading to potential security vulnerabilities - Mitigation: Implement access controls and rate limiting.
- **Low Risk**: Minor performance impact due to additional endpoint - Mitigation: Optimize endpoint logic for minimal resource usage.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 week - Setup & Preparation, Core Development
- **Phase 2**: 1 week - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 3**: 1 week - Deployment, Monitoring setup

This plan provides a structured approach to implementing a health check endpoint, ensuring that all aspects of development, testing, and deployment are covered.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the health check endpoint as outlined in the project plan, we will follow a structured approach, breaking down the tasks into manageable steps. Here's a detailed implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Ensure the repository is up-to-date by pulling the latest changes from the main branch.
   - Create a new feature branch for the health check endpoint, e.g., `feature/health-check-endpoint`.

2. **Development Environment**
   - Verify that the local development environment is correctly configured with Node.js and Express.
   - Ensure that any necessary environment variables are set up for local development.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Check if any additional dependencies are required for the health check (e.g., monitoring libraries).
   - Install any missing dependencies using npm or yarn.

### Phase 2: Core Development

4. **Define the Health Check Endpoint**
   - In the Express application, define a new route for the health check endpoint, e.g., `GET /health`.

5. **Implement Health Check Logic**
   - Implement logic to check the application's health status. This may include:
     - Verifying database connectivity.
     - Checking the availability of essential services.
     - Ensuring the application is responsive.
   - Return a JSON response with the health status and appropriate HTTP status codes:
     - `200 OK` if the application is healthy.
     - `500 Internal Server Error` if any critical component is down.

6. **Security Considerations**
   - If necessary, implement access controls to restrict unauthorized access to the health check endpoint.
   - Consider adding rate limiting to prevent abuse.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

7. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests to cover the health check logic using a testing framework like Mocha or Jest.
   - Ensure tests cover both healthy and unhealthy scenarios.

8. **Integration Tests**
   - Write integration tests to verify that the health check endpoint works correctly within the application context.
   - Test the endpoint's response time to ensure it meets performance requirements.

9. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a peer review of the implemented code to ensure quality and adherence to coding standards.

### Phase 4: Deployment

10. **Build Process**
    - Integrate the health check endpoint into the application's build process.
    - Ensure that the build process includes running all tests.

11. **Deployment Pipeline**
    - Update the deployment pipeline to include the new health check endpoint.
    - Deploy the changes to a staging environment for further testing.

12. **Monitoring Setup**
    - Configure monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to use the health check endpoint for application health verification.
    - Test the monitoring setup to ensure it triggers alerts correctly when the application is unhealthy.

### Phase 5: Documentation & Finalization

13. **Documentation**
    - Update the application documentation to include details about the health check endpoint.
    - Document any configuration steps required for monitoring tools.

14. **Final Testing**
    - Perform final testing in the staging environment to ensure everything works as expected.
    - Validate that the endpoint meets all acceptance criteria.

15. **Deployment to Production**
    - Once all tests pass and the code is approved, deploy the changes to the production environment.

16. **Post-Deployment Monitoring**
    - Monitor the application post-deployment to ensure the health check endpoint functions correctly and does not introduce any issues.

By following this step-by-step strategy, we can ensure a smooth implementation of the health check endpoint, meeting all the project requirements and acceptance criteria.
