        # Project Plan: Add a Simple /status Endpoint that Returns System Uptime

## Overview
The task is to implement a new API endpoint `/status` in the existing system. This endpoint will return the system's uptime, providing a simple way to monitor the health and availability of the service.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the repository is up-to-date and branch is created for the feature.
   - [ ] Development environment: Confirm that the local development environment is configured correctly.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Verify that all necessary dependencies are installed and up-to-date.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Implement `/status` endpoint: Create a new endpoint that calculates and returns the system uptime.
   - [ ] Integrate uptime calculation: Use system libraries or tools to accurately calculate the uptime.
   - [ ] Response formatting: Ensure the response is in a JSON format with a clear structure.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests to verify the uptime calculation and endpoint response.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Ensure the endpoint integrates correctly with the existing system.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a thorough review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Update the build process to include the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Ensure the deployment pipeline is configured to deploy the changes.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Implement monitoring for the new endpoint to track its usage and performance.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Request to `/status` endpoint - Expected: Returns uptime in seconds.
- **Test Case 2**: System uptime calculation - Expected: Correct calculation based on system start time.
- **Test Case 3**: JSON response format - Expected: Response is in valid JSON format with uptime field.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The `/status` endpoint returns the system uptime in seconds.
- [ ] The response is in JSON format.
- [ ] The endpoint is accessible and performs efficiently under load.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express.js (or relevant framework in use)
- **Performance**: The endpoint should respond within 100ms under normal load.
- **Security**: Ensure the endpoint does not expose sensitive information.
- **Scalability**: The endpoint should handle concurrent requests efficiently.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: None identified.
- **Medium Risk**: Incorrect uptime calculation - Mitigation: Use reliable system libraries.
- **Low Risk**: Endpoint performance issues - Mitigation: Conduct load testing and optimize code.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 day - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 days - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 day - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 day - Deployment

This plan outlines the steps necessary to implement a `/status` endpoint that returns the system uptime, ensuring a robust and efficient addition to the system's monitoring capabilities.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the `/status` endpoint that returns the system uptime, we will follow a structured approach based on the provided plan. Here's a detailed step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Pull the latest changes from the main branch to ensure the repository is up-to-date.
   - Create a new feature branch for the `/status` endpoint implementation, e.g., `feature/status-endpoint`.

2. **Development Environment**
   - Verify that the local development environment is correctly configured with Node.js and any other necessary tools.
   - Ensure that the application runs without errors in the local environment.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Check the `package.json` file for any missing dependencies related to Express.js or system uptime calculation.
   - Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are up-to-date.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Implement `/status` Endpoint**
   - Create a new route in the Express.js application for the `/status` endpoint.
   - Define a handler function that will process requests to this endpoint.

2. **Integrate Uptime Calculation**
   - Use Node.js's `process.uptime()` method to calculate the system uptime in seconds.
   - Ensure the uptime calculation is accurate and reflects the time since the application started.

3. **Response Formatting**
   - Format the response as a JSON object, e.g., `{ "uptime": <uptime_in_seconds> }`.
   - Ensure the response is clear and adheres to JSON standards.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests for the uptime calculation to ensure it returns the correct value.
   - Test the `/status` endpoint to verify it returns the expected JSON response.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Ensure the new endpoint integrates correctly with the existing system.
   - Test the endpoint's accessibility and response under various conditions.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a code review with peers to ensure the implementation meets quality standards and follows best practices.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Update any build scripts or configurations to include the new endpoint.
   - Ensure the application builds successfully with the new changes.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Verify that the deployment pipeline is configured to deploy the changes to staging and production environments.
   - Deploy the changes to a staging environment for further testing.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement monitoring for the `/status` endpoint to track its usage and performance.
   - Set up alerts for any anomalies or performance issues.

### Additional Considerations

- **Documentation**
  - Update the API documentation to include details about the new `/status` endpoint.
  - Provide examples of requests and responses.

- **Performance Testing**
  - Conduct load testing to ensure the endpoint performs efficiently under normal and high load conditions.

- **Security Review**
  - Ensure the endpoint does not expose any sensitive information and adheres to security best practices.

By following this strategy, we will implement a robust and efficient `/status` endpoint that meets the project's requirements and acceptance criteria.
