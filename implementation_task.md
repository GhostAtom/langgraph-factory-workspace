        # Project Plan: Add a Simple Health Endpoint

## Overview
The objective of this project is to implement a simple health endpoint in the existing application. This endpoint will provide a quick way to check the application's status and ensure it is running correctly. It will return a basic response indicating the health of the application, which can be used for monitoring and alerting purposes.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the repository is up-to-date and branch is created for the feature.
   - [ ] Development environment: Confirm the development environment is configured correctly.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Verify all necessary dependencies are installed.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Create a new endpoint `/health` in the application.
   - [ ] Implement logic to return a simple JSON response, e.g., `{ "status": "healthy" }`.
   - [ ] Ensure the endpoint is accessible and returns the correct HTTP status code (200 OK).

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests to verify the endpoint returns the expected response.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Ensure the endpoint integrates correctly with the application.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a peer review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Ensure the application builds successfully with the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Update the deployment pipeline to include the new feature.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Configure monitoring to track the health endpoint's availability and response time.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Access the `/health` endpoint - Expected: Returns `{ "status": "healthy" }` with HTTP status 200.
- **Test Case 2**: Simulate application downtime and access `/health` - Expected: Returns appropriate error message and status.
- **Test Case 3**: Load test the `/health` endpoint - Expected: Endpoint remains responsive under load.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The `/health` endpoint returns a JSON response with a status of "healthy".
- [ ] The endpoint is accessible and returns HTTP status 200 when the application is running.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to include details about the new endpoint.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express (or relevant framework)
- **Performance**: The endpoint should respond within 100ms under normal load.
- **Security**: Ensure the endpoint does not expose sensitive information.
- **Scalability**: The endpoint should handle a high number of requests without degradation.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: None identified.
- **Medium Risk**: Potential for the endpoint to expose sensitive information if not properly secured. Mitigation: Review security settings and ensure no sensitive data is returned.
- **Low Risk**: Minor risk of endpoint not being accessible due to misconfiguration. Mitigation: Thorough testing and code review.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 day - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 days - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 day - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 day - Deployment

This plan provides a structured approach to implementing a simple health endpoint, ensuring all necessary steps are taken to deliver a quality feature.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the simple health endpoint as outlined in the project plan, we will follow a structured approach. Here's a step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Ensure the repository is up-to-date by pulling the latest changes from the main branch.
   - Create a new feature branch for the health endpoint, e.g., `feature/health-endpoint`.

2. **Development Environment**
   - Verify that the development environment is correctly configured with Node.js and Express (or the relevant framework).
   - Ensure that the application runs without errors in the current setup.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Check for any missing dependencies that might be required for the new endpoint.
   - Run `npm install` (or the equivalent command) to ensure all dependencies are up-to-date.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Create the `/health` Endpoint**
   - In the Express application, add a new route handler for the `/health` endpoint.
   - Implement the logic to return a JSON response with `{ "status": "healthy" }`.

2. **Ensure Correct HTTP Status Code**
   - Make sure the endpoint returns an HTTP status code of 200 OK when accessed.

3. **Security Considerations**
   - Review the endpoint to ensure it does not expose any sensitive information.
   - Implement any necessary security measures, such as rate limiting, if applicable.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests to verify that the `/health` endpoint returns the expected JSON response and HTTP status code.
   - Use a testing framework like Mocha or Jest for writing and running tests.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Ensure the endpoint integrates correctly with the rest of the application.
   - Test the endpoint in a development environment to confirm it behaves as expected.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a peer review of the code to ensure it adheres to coding standards and best practices.
   - Address any feedback or issues identified during the review.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Verify that the application builds successfully with the new endpoint included.
   - Run any build scripts or commands necessary for deployment.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Update the deployment pipeline to include the new feature.
   - Ensure the pipeline is configured to deploy to staging and production environments.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Configure monitoring tools to track the availability and response time of the `/health` endpoint.
   - Set up alerts for any issues detected with the endpoint.

### Documentation

- Update the application documentation to include details about the new `/health` endpoint.
- Provide information on how to access the endpoint and its expected behavior.

### Testing Scenarios

- **Test Case 1**: Access the `/health` endpoint and verify it returns `{ "status": "healthy" }` with HTTP status 200.
- **Test Case 2**: Simulate application downtime and verify the endpoint returns an appropriate error message and status.
- **Test Case 3**: Perform load testing on the `/health` endpoint to ensure it remains responsive under load.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Ensure all acceptance criteria are met, including the endpoint's accessibility, response, and documentation updates.

By following this strategy, we can systematically implement the health endpoint, ensuring it meets all requirements and is ready for deployment.
