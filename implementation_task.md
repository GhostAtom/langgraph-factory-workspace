        # Project Plan: Add a New API Endpoint for User Status

## Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a new API endpoint that allows clients to retrieve the status of a user. This endpoint will provide information such as whether the user is active, inactive, or suspended. The endpoint will be integrated into the existing user management system and should adhere to the current API standards.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the repository is up-to-date with the latest codebase.
   - [ ] Development environment: Configure the local development environment with necessary tools and access.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Install any new dependencies required for the API development.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Define the API contract: Specify the request and response format for the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Implement the endpoint: Develop the API endpoint to fetch user status from the database.
   - [ ] Integrate with existing user management system: Ensure the new endpoint works seamlessly with the current system.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write unit tests to cover the new endpoint functionality.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Develop integration tests to ensure the endpoint interacts correctly with other system components.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a thorough code review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Update the build process to include the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Configure the deployment pipeline for automated deployment to staging and production.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Implement monitoring to track the performance and usage of the new endpoint.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Retrieve status of an active user - Expected: Status is "active".
- **Test Case 2**: Retrieve status of an inactive user - Expected: Status is "inactive".
- **Test Case 3**: Retrieve status of a suspended user - Expected: Status is "suspended".

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The API endpoint returns the correct status for active, inactive, and suspended users.
- [ ] The endpoint adheres to the existing API standards and conventions.
- [ ] Comprehensive tests are in place and passing.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to include the new endpoint details.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **Performance**: The endpoint should respond within 200ms under normal load.
- **Security**: Implement authentication and authorization to ensure only authorized users can access the endpoint.
- **Scalability**: The endpoint should handle up to 1000 requests per second.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Security vulnerabilities - Mitigation: Conduct a security audit and implement best practices.
- **Medium Risk**: Performance issues under load - Mitigation: Perform load testing and optimize queries.
- **Low Risk**: Integration issues with existing systems - Mitigation: Conduct thorough integration testing.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 week - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 weeks - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 week - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 week - Deployment

This plan outlines the necessary steps to successfully add a new API endpoint for user status, ensuring a smooth integration with the existing system and meeting all technical and business requirements.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the new API endpoint for user status, we will follow a structured approach based on the provided plan. Here's a detailed step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Ensure the local repository is up-to-date with the latest codebase from the main branch.
   - Pull the latest changes and resolve any merge conflicts if necessary.

2. **Development Environment Configuration**
   - Set up the local development environment with Node.js and MongoDB.
   - Ensure that the necessary tools (e.g., Postman for API testing) are installed and configured.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Review the current `package.json` for any missing dependencies required for API development.
   - Install any new dependencies using `npm install`.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Define the API Contract**
   - Specify the request format (e.g., HTTP method, URL path) and response format (e.g., JSON structure) for the new endpoint.
   - Document the API contract for future reference and testing.

2. **Implement the Endpoint**
   - Create a new route in the Express application for the user status endpoint.
   - Implement the logic to fetch user status from the MongoDB database.
   - Ensure the endpoint returns the correct status (active, inactive, suspended) based on user data.

3. **Integrate with Existing User Management System**
   - Ensure the new endpoint is integrated into the existing user management system.
   - Verify that the endpoint adheres to the current API standards and conventions.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests to cover the functionality of the new endpoint.
   - Use a testing framework like Mocha or Jest to automate the tests.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Develop integration tests to ensure the endpoint interacts correctly with other system components.
   - Test scenarios include retrieving statuses for active, inactive, and suspended users.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a thorough code review with peers to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.
   - Address any feedback or issues identified during the review.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Update the build process to include the new endpoint.
   - Ensure that the build is successful and the application is ready for deployment.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Configure the deployment pipeline for automated deployment to staging and production environments.
   - Test the deployment process in a staging environment before moving to production.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement monitoring to track the performance and usage of the new endpoint.
   - Set up alerts for any performance issues or errors.

### Additional Considerations

- **Security**
  - Implement authentication and authorization to ensure only authorized users can access the endpoint.
  - Conduct a security audit to identify and mitigate any vulnerabilities.

- **Performance**
  - Perform load testing to ensure the endpoint can handle up to 1000 requests per second.
  - Optimize database queries and application logic for performance.

- **Documentation**
  - Update the API documentation to include details about the new endpoint.
  - Ensure that the documentation is clear and accessible to developers and clients.

By following this strategy, we aim to implement the new API endpoint for user status efficiently and effectively, ensuring it meets all technical and business requirements.
