   - [ ] Monitoring setup

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Add a new book with valid data - Expected: Book is added successfully
- **Test Case 2**: Retrieve details of an existing book - Expected: Correct book details are returned
- **Test Case 3**: Update a book with valid data - Expected: Book information is updated successfully
- **Test Case 4**: Delete an existing book - Expected: Book is deleted successfully
- **Test Case 5**: Attempt to retrieve a non-existent book - Expected: Appropriate error message is returned

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The function can add, retrieve, update, and delete book records
- [ ] The function handles errors gracefully and returns appropriate HTTP status codes
- [ ] The function is performant and can handle concurrent requests
- [ ] The function is secure and prevents unauthorized access

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Azure Functions, .NET Core, Azure Cosmos DB (or SQL Database), Azure DevOps for CI/CD
- **Performance**: The function should handle up to 1000 requests per second
- **Security**: Implement authentication and authorization, use HTTPS, and validate all inputs
- **Scalability**: The function should scale automatically based on the load

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Security vulnerabilities - Mitigation: Conduct thorough security testing and code reviews
- **Medium Risk**: Performance issues under high load - Mitigation: Implement caching and optimize database queries
- **Low Risk**: Deployment failures - Mitigation: Use automated CI/CD pipelines and rollback strategies

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 week - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 weeks - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 week - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 week - Deployment

This plan outlines the steps necessary to successfully deliver an Azure Function for the Book API, ensuring that all aspects of software delivery are considered and addressed.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the Azure Function for the Book API, we will follow a structured approach based on the provided plan. Here's a detailed step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub for the project.
   - Clone the repository to your local development environment.

2. **Development Environment**
   - Set up your local development environment with the necessary tools:
     - Install .NET Core SDK.
     - Install Azure Functions Core Tools.
     - Set up an IDE like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Initialize a new Azure Functions project using the Azure Functions Core Tools.
   - Add necessary NuGet packages for Azure Cosmos DB or SQL Database integration.
   - Configure the project to use Azure DevOps for CI/CD.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Implement Function to Add a New Book**
   - Create an HTTP-triggered Azure Function to handle POST requests.
   - Implement logic to add a new book record to the database.
   - Validate input data and handle errors appropriately.

2. **Implement Function to Retrieve Book Details**
   - Create an HTTP-triggered Azure Function to handle GET requests.
   - Implement logic to retrieve book details from the database using a book ID.
   - Handle cases where the book does not exist.

3. **Implement Function to Update Book Information**
   - Create an HTTP-triggered Azure Function to handle PUT requests.
   - Implement logic to update existing book information in the database.
   - Validate input data and handle errors appropriately.

4. **Implement Function to Delete a Book**
   - Create an HTTP-triggered Azure Function to handle DELETE requests.
   - Implement logic to delete a book record from the database using a book ID.
   - Handle cases where the book does not exist.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests for each function to ensure they handle various scenarios correctly.
   - Use a testing framework like xUnit or NUnit.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Write integration tests to verify the interaction between the Azure Functions and the database.
   - Ensure that the functions work as expected in a real-world scenario.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a thorough code review to ensure code quality, security, and performance.
   - Address any issues or improvements identified during the review.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Set up a build pipeline in Azure DevOps to automate the build process.
   - Ensure the build process includes running tests and packaging the Azure Functions.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Set up a deployment pipeline in Azure DevOps to automate the deployment to Azure.
   - Configure the pipeline to deploy to a staging environment first, then to production.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement monitoring and logging for the Azure Functions using Azure Application Insights.
   - Set up alerts for any critical issues or performance bottlenecks.

### Additional Considerations

- **Security**
  - Implement authentication and authorization for the API using Azure Active Directory or another identity provider.
  - Ensure all data is transmitted over HTTPS and validate all inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.

- **Performance and Scalability**
  - Optimize database queries and consider implementing caching for frequently accessed data.
  - Configure the Azure Functions to scale automatically based on the load.

- **Documentation**
  - Update the project documentation to include setup instructions, API usage, and any other relevant information.

By following this step-by-step strategy, we can ensure a successful implementation of the Azure Function for the Book API, meeting all the acceptance criteria and technical requirements outlined in the plan.
