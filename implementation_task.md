        # Project Plan: Add a Simple /status Endpoint that Returns System Uptime

## Overview
The task is to implement a new API endpoint `/status` in the existing system. This endpoint will return the system's uptime, providing a simple way to monitor the health and availability of the application.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the repository is up-to-date and branch is created for the feature.
   - [ ] Development environment: Confirm the development environment is configured correctly.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Verify all necessary dependencies are installed.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Implement the `/status` endpoint in the application.
   - [ ] Retrieve system uptime using appropriate system calls or libraries.
   - [ ] Format the uptime data into a JSON response.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests to verify the endpoint returns the correct uptime.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Ensure the endpoint integrates correctly with the existing system.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a peer review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Ensure the application builds successfully with the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Update the deployment pipeline to include the new feature.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Add monitoring for the new endpoint to track its usage and performance.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Request to `/status` endpoint - Expected: Returns JSON with uptime in seconds.
- **Test Case 2**: System uptime is accurately reflected after a known period - Expected: Uptime matches the expected duration.
- **Test Case 3**: Endpoint handles concurrent requests - Expected: Consistent and correct uptime response.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The `/status` endpoint is accessible and returns a JSON object.
- [ ] The JSON object includes a field for uptime in seconds.
- [ ] The endpoint is performant and handles multiple requests efficiently.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express (or relevant framework), System libraries for uptime retrieval.
- **Performance**: The endpoint should respond within 200ms under normal load.
- **Security**: Ensure the endpoint does not expose sensitive information.
- **Scalability**: The endpoint should handle increased load without degradation in performance.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: None identified.
- **Medium Risk**: Incorrect uptime calculation due to system call issues - Mitigation: Use well-tested libraries for uptime retrieval.
- **Low Risk**: Minor performance impact - Mitigation: Monitor and optimize as necessary.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 day - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 days - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 day - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 day - Deployment

This plan provides a structured approach to implementing the `/status` endpoint, ensuring that all aspects of development, testing, and deployment are covered.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the `/status` endpoint that returns the system uptime, we'll follow a structured approach based on the provided plan. Here's a detailed step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Step 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Ensure the local repository is up-to-date with the latest changes from the main branch.
   - Create a new feature branch for the `/status` endpoint implementation, e.g., `feature/status-endpoint`.

2. **Development Environment**
   - Verify that the development environment is correctly configured with Node.js and any necessary tools.
   - Ensure the application is running locally without errors.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Check if any additional libraries are needed for uptime retrieval. If using Node.js, the `os` module is typically sufficient for this purpose.

### Step 2: Core Development

1. **Implement the `/status` Endpoint**
   - Add a new route in the Express application for the `/status` endpoint.
   - Use the `os` module to retrieve the system uptime.

2. **Retrieve System Uptime**
   - Use `os.uptime()` to get the system uptime in seconds.
   - Format the uptime data into a JSON response, e.g., `{ "uptime": <seconds> }`.

3. **Code Implementation**
   - Here is a basic implementation of the `/status` endpoint:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const os = require('os');

   const app = express();

   app.get('/status', (req, res) => {
     const uptime = os.uptime();
     res.json({ uptime });
   });

   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
   app.listen(PORT, () => {
     console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
   });
   ```

### Step 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests to verify that the `/status` endpoint returns the correct uptime.
   - Use a testing framework like Mocha or Jest for writing tests.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Ensure the endpoint integrates correctly with the existing system.
   - Test the endpoint's response time and correctness under different scenarios.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a peer review to ensure the code adheres to best practices and standards.
   - Make any necessary adjustments based on feedback.

### Step 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Ensure the application builds successfully with the new endpoint.
   - Run any build scripts or processes required for deployment.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Update the deployment pipeline to include the new feature.
   - Deploy the changes to a staging environment for further testing.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Add monitoring for the new endpoint to track its usage and performance.
   - Use tools like New Relic or Datadog to monitor response times and error rates.

### Step 5: Documentation

- Update the project documentation to include details about the new `/status` endpoint.
- Document the API contract, including the expected JSON response format.

### Step 6: Final Review and Deployment

- Ensure all tests are passing and the code is reviewed and approved.
- Deploy the changes to the production environment.
- Verify the endpoint is functioning correctly in production.

By following these steps, we ensure a comprehensive implementation of the `/status` endpoint, covering development, testing, and deployment phases.
