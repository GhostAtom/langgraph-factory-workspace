   - [ ] Implement branch naming rules: Develop scripts or tools to enforce branch naming conventions.
   - [ ] Integrate with CI/CD: Ensure branch naming rules are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
   - [ ] Develop a rollback plan: Create a strategy to revert changes if the new naming convention causes issues.

3. **Testing & Quality**

   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Update the deployment pipeline to recognize and process branches according to the new naming convention.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Implement monitoring to track the adoption and effectiveness of the new branch naming rules.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Create a branch with a valid name - Expected: Branch is created successfully.
- **Test Case 2**: Create a branch with an invalid name - Expected: Branch creation is blocked with an error message.
- **Test Case 3**: Attempt to merge a branch with an invalid name - Expected: Merge is blocked with an error message.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Branch naming rules are clearly defined and documented.
- [ ] Branch naming rules are enforced automatically.
- [ ] All team members are trained on the new branch naming convention.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Git, CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions)
- **Performance**: Branch naming enforcement should not add significant overhead to the development process.
- **Security**: Ensure that branch naming rules do not expose any sensitive information.
- **Scalability**: The solution should support a large number of branches and users.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Resistance to change from team members - Mitigation: Provide training and documentation.
- **Medium Risk**: Integration issues with existing CI/CD pipelines - Mitigation: Conduct thorough testing and have a rollback plan.
- **Low Risk**: Minor bugs in branch naming scripts - Mitigation: Implement comprehensive testing and code reviews.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 week - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 weeks - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 week - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 week - Deployment

This plan provides a structured approach to implementing and testing a new branch naming convention, ensuring a smooth transition and minimal disruption to the development workflow.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the project plan for testing the Cursor branch naming convention, we will follow a structured approach, breaking down the tasks into manageable steps. Here's a detailed implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - **Objective**: Ensure the repository is configured to support branch naming rules.
   - **Steps**:
     - Access the GitHub repository.
     - Check the repository settings for branch protection rules.
     - Configure branch protection rules to include naming conventions if supported.

2. **Development Environment**
   - **Objective**: Set up local development environments for testing branch naming.
   - **Steps**:
     - Clone the repository to your local machine.
     - Ensure Git is installed and configured.
     - Set up any necessary environment variables or configurations.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - **Objective**: Install any necessary tools or libraries for branch naming enforcement.
   - **Steps**:
     - Identify tools or libraries needed (e.g., Git hooks, pre-commit).
     - Install these tools using package managers like npm, pip, or directly from source.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Implement Branch Naming Rules**
   - **Objective**: Develop scripts or tools to enforce branch naming conventions.
   - **Steps**:
     - Define the branch naming convention (e.g., feature/XYZ-123-description).
     - Create a script or Git hook to validate branch names against the convention.
     - Test the script locally to ensure it blocks invalid branch names.

2. **Integrate with CI/CD**
   - **Objective**: Ensure branch naming rules are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
   - **Steps**:
     - Modify the CI/CD configuration (e.g., Jenkinsfile, GitHub Actions) to include branch name validation.
     - Test the CI/CD pipeline to ensure it fails on invalid branch names.

3. **Develop a Rollback Plan**
   - **Objective**: Create a strategy to revert changes if the new naming convention causes issues.
   - **Steps**:
     - Document the steps to disable the branch naming enforcement.
     - Ensure backups of any configuration changes are available.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - **Objective**: Write tests to verify branch naming rules are correctly enforced.
   - **Steps**:
     - Write unit tests for the branch naming script.
     - Use a testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha) to automate these tests.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - **Objective**: Test the integration of branch naming rules with existing workflows.
   - **Steps**:
     - Simulate branch creation and merging in a test environment.
     - Verify that the CI/CD pipeline correctly enforces branch naming rules.

3. **Code Review**
   - **Objective**: Conduct a thorough review of the code to ensure quality and adherence to standards.
   - **Steps**:
     - Submit the code for peer review.
     - Address any feedback or issues identified during the review.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - **Objective**: Ensure the build process accommodates the new branch naming rules.
   - **Steps**:
     - Verify that the build process does not break due to branch naming enforcement.
     - Update any build scripts if necessary.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - **Objective**: Update the deployment pipeline to recognize and process branches according to the new naming convention.
   - **Steps**:
     - Modify deployment scripts to handle the new branch naming convention.
     - Test the deployment process to ensure it works with the new rules.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - **Objective**: Implement monitoring to track the adoption and effectiveness of the new branch naming rules.
   - **Steps**:
     - Set up logging or monitoring tools to track branch creation and naming compliance.
     - Review logs regularly to ensure compliance and identify any issues.

### Final Steps

- **Documentation**: Update project documentation to include the new branch naming convention and enforcement process.
- **Training**: Conduct training sessions for team members to familiarize them with the new branch naming rules.
- **Deployment to Staging/Production**: Once all tests pass and the code is reviewed, deploy the changes to the staging environment, followed by production.

By following this step-by-step strategy, we can ensure a smooth implementation of the new branch naming convention with minimal disruption to the development workflow.
