        # Project Plan: Add Health Check Endpoint

## Overview
The task involves adding a health check endpoint to the existing application. This endpoint will provide a simple way to verify that the application is running and responsive. It will return a status indicating the health of the application, which can be used for monitoring and alerting purposes.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the repository is up-to-date with the latest code.
   - [ ] Development environment: Set up the local development environment.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Install any necessary dependencies for the health check functionality.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Define the health check endpoint route.
   - [ ] Implement the logic to check the application's health status.
   - [ ] Return appropriate HTTP status codes and messages.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests to verify the health check endpoint's functionality.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Ensure the endpoint works correctly within the application.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a peer review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Ensure the application builds successfully with the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Update the deployment pipeline to include the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Configure monitoring tools to use the health check endpoint for application status.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Health check endpoint returns 200 OK when the application is healthy - Expected: HTTP 200 status code with a "healthy" message.
- **Test Case 2**: Health check endpoint returns 500 Internal Server Error when the application is not healthy - Expected: HTTP 500 status code with an "unhealthy" message.
- **Test Case 3**: Health check endpoint is accessible without authentication - Expected: Endpoint can be accessed publicly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Health check endpoint is accessible at `/health`.
- [ ] Endpoint returns 200 OK when the application is healthy.
- [ ] Endpoint returns 500 Internal Server Error when the application is not healthy.
- [ ] Endpoint is documented in the API documentation.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express (or relevant framework)
- **Performance**: Endpoint should respond within 100ms under normal load.
- **Security**: Ensure the endpoint does not expose sensitive information.
- **Scalability**: Endpoint should handle concurrent requests efficiently.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Misconfiguration leading to false health status - Mitigation: Thorough testing and validation.
- **Medium Risk**: Endpoint exposure leading to security vulnerabilities - Mitigation: Ensure no sensitive data is exposed.
- **Low Risk**: Performance degradation - Mitigation: Optimize endpoint response time.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 day - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 days - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 day - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 day - Deployment

This plan provides a structured approach to adding a health check endpoint, ensuring that all necessary steps are taken to deliver a robust and reliable feature.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the health check endpoint as outlined in the project plan, we will follow a structured approach. Here's a step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Pull the latest changes from the main branch to ensure the local repository is up-to-date.
   - Create a new feature branch for the health check endpoint implementation.

2. **Development Environment**
   - Ensure the local development environment is set up with Node.js and any necessary tools.
   - Verify that the application runs correctly in the local environment.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Review the current dependencies to determine if any additional packages are needed for the health check functionality.
   - Install any necessary dependencies using `npm install`.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Define the Health Check Endpoint Route**
   - In the Express application, define a new route for the health check endpoint at `/health`.

2. **Implement the Logic to Check Application's Health Status**
   - Create a function that checks the application's health. This could involve checking database connectivity, service availability, etc.
   - Ensure the function returns a boolean or status indicating the health of the application.

3. **Return Appropriate HTTP Status Codes and Messages**
   - Implement logic to return a `200 OK` status with a "healthy" message if the application is healthy.
   - Return a `500 Internal Server Error` status with an "unhealthy" message if the application is not healthy.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests for the health check function to ensure it correctly assesses the application's health.
   - Use a testing framework like Mocha or Jest for writing and running tests.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Write integration tests to verify that the health check endpoint works correctly within the application.
   - Test the endpoint's response under different scenarios (healthy and unhealthy states).

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a peer review of the implemented code to ensure it meets quality standards and adheres to best practices.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Ensure the application builds successfully with the new health check endpoint.
   - Run any build scripts or processes required for deployment.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Update the deployment pipeline to include the new endpoint.
   - Deploy the changes to a staging environment for further testing.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Configure monitoring tools to use the health check endpoint for application status.
   - Ensure alerts are set up to notify the team in case of an unhealthy status.

### Additional Steps

- **Documentation**
  - Update the API documentation to include details about the new health check endpoint.
  - Ensure the documentation covers the endpoint's purpose, usage, and expected responses.

- **Security Review**
  - Conduct a security review to ensure the endpoint does not expose any sensitive information.
  - Verify that the endpoint is accessible without authentication as per the requirements.

### Final Steps

- **Testing in Staging**
  - Test the health check endpoint in the staging environment to ensure it behaves as expected.
  - Validate that the endpoint meets all acceptance criteria.

- **Deployment to Production**
  - Once all tests pass and the code is approved, deploy the changes to the production environment.

- **Post-Deployment Monitoring**
  - Monitor the application post-deployment to ensure the health check endpoint is functioning correctly.

By following this strategy, we can ensure a smooth implementation of the health check endpoint, meeting all the defined requirements and acceptance criteria.
