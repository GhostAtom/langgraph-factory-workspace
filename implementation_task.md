        # Project Plan: Add Health Check Endpoint

## Overview
The task involves adding a health check endpoint to the existing application. This endpoint will provide a simple way to verify that the application is running and responsive. It will be used by monitoring tools to ensure the application is healthy and to trigger alerts if it is not.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the latest code is pulled and a new branch is created for the feature.
   - [ ] Development environment: Confirm the local development environment is configured correctly.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Verify all necessary dependencies are installed and up to date.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Define the health check endpoint route and method (e.g., GET /health).
   - [ ] Implement the logic to check the application's health (e.g., database connection, service availability).
   - [ ] Return appropriate HTTP status codes and messages based on the health status.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests to cover the health check logic.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Ensure the endpoint works correctly within the application.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a peer review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Ensure the application builds successfully with the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Update the CI/CD pipeline to include the new feature.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Configure monitoring tools to use the new health check endpoint.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Health check endpoint returns 200 OK when the application is healthy - Expected: HTTP 200 OK
- **Test Case 2**: Health check endpoint returns 500 Internal Server Error when the application is unhealthy - Expected: HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
- **Test Case 3**: Health check endpoint returns appropriate error message when a specific service is down - Expected: Error message indicating the service issue

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The health check endpoint is accessible and returns the correct status.
- [ ] The endpoint accurately reflects the application's health status.
- [ ] Monitoring tools are configured to use the health check endpoint.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express (or relevant framework)
- **Performance**: The endpoint should respond within 100ms under normal conditions.
- **Security**: Ensure the endpoint does not expose sensitive information.
- **Scalability**: The endpoint should handle a high number of requests without degradation.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Misconfiguration of monitoring tools leading to false alerts - Mitigation: Thorough testing and validation of monitoring setup.
- **Medium Risk**: Endpoint performance issues under load - Mitigation: Load testing and optimization.
- **Low Risk**: Minor bugs in health check logic - Mitigation: Comprehensive unit and integration testing.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 day - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 days - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 day - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 day - Deployment and Monitoring Setup

This plan provides a structured approach to adding a health check endpoint, ensuring it is implemented efficiently and effectively, with minimal risk to the existing application.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the health check endpoint as outlined in the project plan, we will follow a structured approach, breaking down the tasks into manageable steps. Here's a detailed implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Pull the latest code from the main branch to ensure you have the most recent version of the application.
   - Create a new feature branch for the health check endpoint, e.g., `feature/health-check-endpoint`.

2. **Development Environment**
   - Verify that your local development environment is correctly configured. This includes ensuring Node.js and any other necessary tools are installed and up to date.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Check the `package.json` file for any dependencies that might be required for the health check functionality. Install or update them using `npm install`.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Define the Health Check Endpoint**
   - In your Express application, define a new route for the health check endpoint, e.g., `GET /health`.

2. **Implement Health Check Logic**
   - Create a function to check the application's health. This should include:
     - Verifying the database connection.
     - Checking the availability of any critical services.
   - The function should return a status object indicating the health of each component.

3. **Return Appropriate HTTP Status Codes**
   - If all checks pass, return an HTTP 200 OK status with a message indicating the application is healthy.
   - If any check fails, return an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error with a message detailing the issue.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests for the health check logic to ensure each component is correctly assessed.
   - Use a testing framework like Mocha or Jest to automate these tests.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test the health check endpoint within the context of the entire application to ensure it behaves as expected.
   - Simulate different scenarios, such as a database connection failure, to verify the endpoint's response.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a peer review of the code to ensure it meets quality standards and adheres to best practices.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Ensure the application builds successfully with the new health check endpoint included.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Update the CI/CD pipeline to incorporate the new feature. This may involve adding new steps to test and deploy the health check endpoint.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Configure monitoring tools to use the new health check endpoint. This involves setting up alerts for when the endpoint returns an error status.

### Additional Considerations

- **Documentation**
  - Update the application documentation to include details about the new health check endpoint, its purpose, and how to use it.

- **Performance Testing**
  - Conduct load testing to ensure the endpoint can handle a high number of requests without performance degradation.

- **Security**
  - Review the endpoint to ensure it does not expose any sensitive information. Consider adding authentication if necessary.

By following this step-by-step strategy, we can efficiently implement the health check endpoint, ensuring it meets all the acceptance criteria and technical requirements outlined in the project plan.
