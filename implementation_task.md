        # Project Plan: Add a /health Endpoint

## Overview
The task involves adding a new `/health` endpoint to the existing application. This endpoint will provide a simple health check for the application, indicating whether the service is up and running. It will return a status code and a message indicating the health status of the application.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the latest code is pulled from the main branch.
   - [ ] Development environment: Confirm the local development environment is configured correctly.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Verify all necessary dependencies are installed.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Create a new route for the `/health` endpoint.
   - [ ] Implement logic to check the application's health status.
   - [ ] Return a JSON response with the health status and a relevant message.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests to verify the `/health` endpoint returns the correct status and message.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Ensure the endpoint integrates correctly with the rest of the application.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a peer review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Ensure the application builds successfully with the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Update the CI/CD pipeline to include tests for the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Add monitoring for the `/health` endpoint to track its availability and performance.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Access the `/health` endpoint when the application is running - Expected: Status code 200, message "Service is healthy".
- **Test Case 2**: Access the `/health` endpoint when the application is down - Expected: Status code 503, message "Service is unavailable".
- **Test Case 3**: Validate the response format of the `/health` endpoint - Expected: JSON format with keys `status` and `message`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The `/health` endpoint returns a 200 status code when the application is healthy.
- [ ] The `/health` endpoint returns a 503 status code when the application is not healthy.
- [ ] The response from the `/health` endpoint is in JSON format.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Performance**: The endpoint should respond within 100ms under normal load.
- **Security**: Ensure the endpoint does not expose sensitive information.
- **Scalability**: The endpoint should handle up to 1000 requests per second.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: None identified.
- **Medium Risk**: Potential for incorrect health status reporting - Mitigation: Thorough testing and monitoring.
- **Low Risk**: Minor performance impact - Mitigation: Optimize endpoint logic and monitor performance.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 day - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 days - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 day - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 day - Deployment

This plan provides a structured approach to adding a `/health` endpoint, ensuring all aspects of development, testing, and deployment are covered.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the `/health` endpoint according to the provided plan, we will follow a structured approach. Here's a step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Pull the latest code from the main branch using Git:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git pull origin main
     ```

2. **Development Environment**
   - Ensure your local development environment is configured correctly. This includes having Node.js and npm installed and configured.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Verify all necessary dependencies are installed by running:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Create a New Route for the `/health` Endpoint**
   - Open the main server file (e.g., `app.js` or `server.js`).
   - Use Express.js to define a new route for `/health`.

2. **Implement Logic to Check the Application's Health Status**
   - For simplicity, assume the application is healthy if it is running. You can expand this logic to include checks for database connectivity or other services if needed.

3. **Return a JSON Response with the Health Status and a Relevant Message**
   - Implement the route handler to return a JSON response. For example:
     ```javascript
     app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
       res.status(200).json({ status: 'healthy', message: 'Service is healthy' });
     });
     ```

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests to verify the `/health` endpoint returns the correct status and message. Use a testing framework like Mocha or Jest.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Ensure the endpoint integrates correctly with the rest of the application. This might involve testing the endpoint in a staging environment.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a peer review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards. Use GitHub's pull request feature for this.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Ensure the application builds successfully with the new endpoint. Run:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Update the CI/CD pipeline to include tests for the new endpoint. This might involve modifying configuration files for your CI/CD tool (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Add monitoring for the `/health` endpoint to track its availability and performance. Use a monitoring tool like New Relic or Datadog.

### Test Cases

- **Test Case 1**: Access the `/health` endpoint when the application is running. Verify it returns a status code 200 and message "Service is healthy".
- **Test Case 2**: Simulate the application being down and verify the endpoint returns a status code 503 and message "Service is unavailable".
- **Test Case 3**: Validate the response format of the `/health` endpoint. Ensure it is in JSON format with keys `status` and `message`.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Ensure the `/health` endpoint returns the correct status codes and messages as per the acceptance criteria.
- Verify the response is in JSON format.

### Technical Considerations

- Ensure the endpoint responds within 100ms under normal load.
- Do not expose sensitive information in the response.
- Ensure the endpoint can handle up to 1000 requests per second.

### Risk Mitigation

- Conduct thorough testing and monitoring to mitigate the risk of incorrect health status reporting.
- Optimize endpoint logic to minimize performance impact.

By following this strategy, we can ensure a successful implementation of the `/health` endpoint.
