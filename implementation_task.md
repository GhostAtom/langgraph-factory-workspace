        # Project Plan: Add User Authentication

## Overview
The goal of this project is to implement OAuth2 authentication for user login. This will enhance the security of the application by allowing users to log in using a secure and standardized authentication protocol. The feature will support multiple OAuth2 providers, such as Google, Facebook, and GitHub, to offer flexibility and convenience to users.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved

- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the repository is ready for development with the latest codebase.
   - [ ] Development environment: Configure local development environments with necessary tools and configurations.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Install required libraries and packages for OAuth2 integration.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Implement OAuth2 client: Develop the client-side logic to initiate and handle OAuth2 authentication flows.
   - [ ] Integrate with OAuth2 providers: Set up and configure integrations with Google, Facebook, and GitHub.
   - [ ] User session management: Implement logic to manage user sessions post-authentication.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests for individual components and functions related to authentication.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Test the complete authentication flow with each OAuth2 provider.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct thorough code reviews to ensure quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Ensure the build process includes all necessary steps for the new feature.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Update the CI/CD pipeline to include tests and deployment steps for the authentication feature.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Implement monitoring to track authentication success rates and potential issues.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: User logs in with Google - Expected: User is authenticated and redirected to the dashboard.
- **Test Case 2**: User logs in with Facebook - Expected: User is authenticated and redirected to the dashboard.
- **Test Case 3**: User logs in with GitHub - Expected: User is authenticated and redirected to the dashboard.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can log in using Google, Facebook, and GitHub.
- [ ] User sessions are managed securely.
- [ ] Authentication errors are handled gracefully with user-friendly messages.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express, Passport.js, OAuth2
- **Performance**: Authentication should not add more than 200ms to the login process.
- **Security**: Ensure secure storage of tokens and use HTTPS for all authentication requests.
- **Scalability**: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent authentication requests.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Misconfiguration of OAuth2 providers - Mitigation: Thoroughly test each provider configuration in a staging environment.
- **Medium Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in token management - Mitigation: Conduct security audits and use secure libraries.
- **Low Risk**: User confusion with multiple login options - Mitigation: Provide clear instructions and UI guidance.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 week - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 weeks - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 week - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 week - Deployment

This plan outlines the steps necessary to successfully implement OAuth2 authentication, ensuring a secure and user-friendly login experience.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the OAuth2 authentication feature as outlined in the project plan, we will follow a structured approach. Here's a detailed step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Ensure the repository is up-to-date with the latest codebase.
   - Create a new branch for the OAuth2 authentication feature to keep changes isolated.

2. **Development Environment Configuration**
   - Set up local development environments with Node.js and Express.
   - Ensure all team members have the necessary tools installed, such as Node.js, npm, and Git.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Install necessary libraries for OAuth2 integration, such as `passport`, `passport-google-oauth20`, `passport-facebook`, and `passport-github`.
   - Update the `package.json` file to include these dependencies.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Implement OAuth2 Client**
   - Set up Passport.js in the Express application.
   - Configure Passport strategies for Google, Facebook, and GitHub.
   - Implement routes to initiate the OAuth2 flow and handle callbacks.

2. **Integrate with OAuth2 Providers**
   - Register the application with Google, Facebook, and GitHub to obtain client IDs and secrets.
   - Configure environment variables to securely store these credentials.
   - Implement logic to handle provider-specific responses and extract user information.

3. **User Session Management**
   - Use Passport.js to serialize and deserialize user sessions.
   - Implement session management to maintain user login state across requests.
   - Ensure secure storage of session data, possibly using a session store like Redis.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests for individual components and functions related to OAuth2 authentication.
   - Use a testing framework like Mocha or Jest for Node.js.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test the complete authentication flow with each OAuth2 provider.
   - Simulate user interactions and verify that users are authenticated and redirected correctly.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct thorough code reviews to ensure code quality and adherence to best practices.
   - Address any feedback or issues identified during the review process.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Ensure the build process includes all necessary steps for the new feature.
   - Verify that the application builds successfully with the new authentication logic.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Update the CI/CD pipeline to include tests and deployment steps for the authentication feature.
   - Ensure automated tests are run as part of the deployment process.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement monitoring to track authentication success rates and potential issues.
   - Use tools like New Relic or Datadog to monitor application performance and security.

### Additional Considerations

- **Documentation**
  - Update the project documentation to include setup instructions for OAuth2 providers.
  - Provide user-facing documentation to guide users through the login process.

- **Security**
  - Conduct a security audit to ensure secure storage of tokens and use of HTTPS.
  - Implement measures to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.

- **User Experience**
  - Design a user-friendly interface for selecting login options.
  - Provide clear instructions and error messages to guide users through the authentication process.

By following this strategy, we can ensure a successful implementation of OAuth2 authentication, meeting all the acceptance criteria and technical requirements outlined in the project plan.
