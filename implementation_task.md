        # Project Plan: Add a Simple Test Endpoint

## Overview
The objective of this project is to add a simple test endpoint to the existing application. This endpoint will be used to verify the basic functionality and connectivity of the application. It should return a static message indicating that the application is running correctly.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the repository is up-to-date with the latest code.
   - [ ] Development environment: Set up the local development environment.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Install any necessary dependencies for the project.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Create a new route for the test endpoint.
   - [ ] Implement the logic to return a static message (e.g., "Application is running").
   - [ ] Ensure the endpoint is accessible and correctly integrated into the application.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write unit tests to verify the endpoint returns the correct message.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Ensure the endpoint works correctly within the application.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a code review to ensure quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Ensure the application builds correctly with the new endpoint.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Update the deployment pipeline to include the new changes.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Set up monitoring to ensure the endpoint is functioning as expected.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Access the test endpoint - Expected: Returns "Application is running".
- **Test Case 2**: Access the test endpoint with incorrect method - Expected: Returns method not allowed error.
- **Test Case 3**: Access the test endpoint with incorrect URL - Expected: Returns 404 error.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The test endpoint returns a static message indicating the application is running.
- [ ] The endpoint is accessible via the correct URL and HTTP method.
- [ ] All tests pass successfully.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express (or relevant framework)
- **Performance**: The endpoint should respond within 200ms.
- **Security**: Ensure the endpoint does not expose any sensitive information.
- **Scalability**: The endpoint should handle a minimum of 100 requests per second.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: None identified.
- **Medium Risk**: Potential integration issues with existing routes - Mitigation: Thorough testing and code review.
- **Low Risk**: Minor performance impact - Mitigation: Monitor performance post-deployment.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 day - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 days - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 day - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 day - Deployment

This plan outlines the steps necessary to successfully add a simple test endpoint to the application, ensuring it meets all functional and quality requirements.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the plan of adding a simple test endpoint to the application, we will follow a structured approach. Here is a step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Pull the latest changes from the main branch of the repository to ensure your local copy is up-to-date.
   - Create a new feature branch for the implementation, e.g., `feature/add-test-endpoint`.

2. **Development Environment**
   - Ensure your local development environment is set up with the necessary tools and configurations for Node.js and Express development.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Verify that all necessary dependencies are installed. If the project uses a package manager like npm or yarn, run `npm install` or `yarn install` to ensure all dependencies are up-to-date.

### Phase 2: Core Development

4. **Create a New Route for the Test Endpoint**
   - In the Express application, create a new route file if necessary, or add the route to an existing file.
   - Define a new route, e.g., `/api/test`, that will handle GET requests.

5. **Implement the Logic to Return a Static Message**
   - In the route handler, implement the logic to return a static message, such as "Application is running".
   - Ensure the response is in JSON format if that is the standard for the application.

6. **Integration**
   - Integrate the new route into the main application file, ensuring it is accessible when the application is running.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

7. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests for the new endpoint to verify it returns the correct static message.
   - Use a testing framework like Mocha or Jest to implement these tests.

8. **Integration Tests**
   - Write integration tests to ensure the endpoint works correctly within the application context.
   - Test for correct HTTP method handling and URL accessibility.

9. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a code review with peers to ensure the implementation meets quality standards and adheres to best practices.

### Phase 4: Deployment

10. **Build Process**
    - Ensure the application builds correctly with the new endpoint. Run any build scripts or processes required.

11. **Deployment Pipeline**
    - Update the deployment pipeline to include the new changes. This may involve updating CI/CD configurations.

12. **Monitoring Setup**
    - Set up monitoring to ensure the endpoint is functioning as expected post-deployment. This could involve logging or using monitoring tools.

### Test Cases

- **Test Case 1**: Access the test endpoint and verify it returns "Application is running".
- **Test Case 2**: Attempt to access the test endpoint with an incorrect HTTP method and verify it returns a method not allowed error.
- **Test Case 3**: Attempt to access the test endpoint with an incorrect URL and verify it returns a 404 error.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Ensure the test endpoint returns the correct static message.
- Verify the endpoint is accessible via the correct URL and HTTP method.
- Confirm all tests pass successfully.

### Final Steps

- Once all tasks are completed and verified, merge the feature branch into the main branch.
- Deploy the changes to the staging environment for further testing.
- After successful testing in staging, deploy to production.

By following this strategy, we ensure a structured and thorough implementation of the test endpoint, meeting all the defined requirements and acceptance criteria.
