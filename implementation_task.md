        # Project Plan: Hello World Microservice

## Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a simple "Hello World" microservice. This microservice will respond with a "Hello, World!" message when accessed via an HTTP GET request. It will serve as a foundational example for building and deploying microservices.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Create a new repository for the microservice.
   - [ ] Development environment: Configure local development environment with necessary tools.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Install required libraries and frameworks (e.g., Express for Node.js).

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Create a basic HTTP server: Set up a server to listen for incoming requests.
   - [ ] Implement GET endpoint: Develop an endpoint that returns "Hello, World!".
   - [ ] Logging: Implement basic logging for incoming requests and responses.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write tests to ensure the endpoint returns the correct response.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Test the microservice in a controlled environment to ensure it works as expected.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a peer review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Create a build script to package the microservice.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Implement basic monitoring to track service uptime and performance.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Access the GET endpoint - Expected: Response "Hello, World!"
- **Test Case 2**: Access the endpoint with query parameters - Expected: Response "Hello, World!" (parameters ignored)
- **Test Case 3**: Access the endpoint with incorrect HTTP method (e.g., POST) - Expected: 405 Method Not Allowed

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The microservice responds with "Hello, World!" to a GET request.
- [ ] The service is accessible and operational in the staging environment.
- [ ] All tests pass successfully.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express, Docker
- **Performance**: Must handle 100 requests per second with a response time under 200ms.
- **Security**: Basic security headers should be implemented.
- **Scalability**: The service should be containerized to allow easy scaling.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: None identified for this simple service.
- **Medium Risk**: Deployment issues - Mitigation: Use a CI/CD pipeline for consistent deployments.
- **Low Risk**: Performance under load - Mitigation: Conduct load testing and optimize as needed.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 day - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 days - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 day - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 day - Deployment

This plan provides a clear path for developing and deploying a simple "Hello World" microservice, ensuring all necessary steps are taken to deliver a quality product.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the "Hello World" microservice according to the provided plan, we will follow a structured approach, breaking down the tasks into manageable steps. Here's a detailed implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub named `hello-world-microservice`.
   - Clone the repository to your local development environment.

2. **Development Environment Configuration**
   - Ensure Node.js and npm are installed on your local machine.
   - Initialize a new Node.js project using `npm init` in the project directory.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Install Express.js by running `npm install express`.
   - Install any other necessary development tools, such as `nodemon` for auto-reloading during development.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Create a Basic HTTP Server**
   - Set up a basic Express server in a file named `server.js`.
   - Configure the server to listen on a specified port (e.g., 3000).

2. **Implement GET Endpoint**
   - Define a GET endpoint at the root path (`/`) that responds with "Hello, World!".
   - Ensure the endpoint ignores any query parameters.

3. **Logging Implementation**
   - Use a logging library like `morgan` to log incoming requests and responses.
   - Install `morgan` using `npm install morgan` and integrate it into the Express app.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Set up a testing framework like `Jest` or `Mocha` by installing it via npm.
   - Write unit tests to verify that the GET endpoint returns "Hello, World!".
   - Test for handling of query parameters and incorrect HTTP methods.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Use a tool like `supertest` to perform integration tests on the microservice.
   - Ensure the service behaves correctly in a controlled environment.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a peer review of the code to ensure it meets quality standards and follows best practices.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Create a Dockerfile to containerize the microservice.
   - Ensure the Dockerfile is optimized for production use.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline using a service like GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
   - Automate the build and deployment process to a staging environment.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement basic monitoring using a tool like Prometheus or a cloud provider's monitoring service.
   - Track service uptime and performance metrics.

### Additional Considerations

- **Security**
  - Implement basic security headers using middleware like `helmet`.
  - Ensure the service is not vulnerable to common web security issues.

- **Performance Testing**
  - Conduct load testing using a tool like `Apache JMeter` or `k6` to ensure the service can handle 100 requests per second with a response time under 200ms.

- **Documentation**
  - Update the README file with instructions on how to set up, run, and test the microservice.
  - Document the API endpoint and any configuration options.

### Timeline

- **Day 1**: Complete setup and preparation tasks.
- **Day 2-3**: Focus on core development tasks.
- **Day 4**: Conduct testing and quality assurance.
- **Day 5**: Deploy the service and set up monitoring.

By following this strategy, we can ensure a smooth implementation of the "Hello World" microservice, meeting all the acceptance criteria and technical requirements outlined in the plan.
