        # Project Plan: Complete E2E Test with Azure Resource Group Creation

## Overview
The project involves developing and executing an end-to-end (E2E) test that includes the creation of an Azure Resource Group. This will ensure that the process of provisioning resources in Azure is functioning correctly and can be automated as part of a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Create a new repository or branch for the E2E test.
   - [ ] Development environment: Configure local and CI environments for Azure SDK and testing tools.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Install necessary packages such as Azure SDK for Python/Node.js, testing frameworks, etc.

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Implement Azure authentication: Set up service principal or managed identity for authentication.
   - [ ] Develop script for Resource Group creation: Write a script to create a Resource Group using Azure SDK.
   - [ ] Integrate script into E2E test framework: Ensure the script is part of the automated test suite.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write unit tests for the script logic.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Develop integration tests to verify the Resource Group creation in Azure.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct peer reviews to ensure code quality and adherence to best practices.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Configure build scripts to include the E2E test.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Integrate the E2E test into the CI/CD pipeline.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Implement logging and monitoring for test execution and Azure operations.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Verify Resource Group creation - Expected: Resource Group is created successfully in the specified Azure subscription.
- **Test Case 2**: Handle authentication errors - Expected: Proper error messages are logged and test fails gracefully.
- **Test Case 3**: Validate Resource Group properties - Expected: Resource Group has the correct name, location, and tags.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The E2E test successfully creates a Resource Group in Azure.
- [ ] The test handles errors and logs them appropriately.
- [ ] The test is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline and runs automatically.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Azure SDK, Python/Node.js, Testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha, PyTest)
- **Performance**: Test execution should complete within 5 minutes.
- **Security**: Use secure methods for storing and accessing Azure credentials.
- **Scalability**: The test should be able to run concurrently with other tests in the pipeline.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Misconfiguration of Azure credentials leading to unauthorized access. Mitigation: Use secure vaults and environment variables for credentials.
- **Medium Risk**: Azure service outages affecting test execution. Mitigation: Implement retry logic and fallback mechanisms.
- **Low Risk**: Test script errors due to SDK updates. Mitigation: Regularly update dependencies and test compatibility.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 week - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 weeks - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 week - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 week - Deployment

This plan provides a structured approach to developing and integrating an E2E test for Azure Resource Group creation, ensuring that the process is reliable, secure, and automated.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the E2E test for Azure Resource Group creation, we will follow a structured approach based on the provided plan. Here's a detailed step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Create a new repository or branch dedicated to the E2E test.
   - Initialize the repository with a README file and a `.gitignore` file suitable for the chosen technology stack (Python/Node.js).

2. **Development Environment Configuration**
   - Set up the local development environment with the necessary tools and SDKs.
   - Configure the CI environment to support Azure SDK and testing tools. This may involve setting up a CI service like GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or Azure DevOps.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Install the Azure SDK for the chosen language (Python or Node.js).
   - Install a testing framework such as PyTest for Python or Jest/Mocha for Node.js.
   - Document the installation steps in the README file for future reference.

### Phase 2: Core Development

4. **Implement Azure Authentication**
   - Set up a service principal or managed identity for Azure authentication.
   - Use environment variables or a secure vault to store Azure credentials securely.
   - Write a utility function to authenticate with Azure using the SDK.

5. **Develop Script for Resource Group Creation**
   - Write a script using the Azure SDK to create a Resource Group.
   - Ensure the script accepts parameters for the Resource Group name, location, and tags.
   - Implement error handling to manage potential issues like authentication failures or invalid parameters.

6. **Integrate Script into E2E Test Framework**
   - Create an E2E test suite using the chosen testing framework.
   - Integrate the Resource Group creation script into the test suite.
   - Write test cases to verify the successful creation of the Resource Group and handle errors gracefully.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

7. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests for the script logic, focusing on individual functions and error handling.
   - Use mocking to simulate Azure SDK responses where necessary.

8. **Integration Tests**
   - Develop integration tests to verify the actual creation of the Resource Group in Azure.
   - Ensure tests validate the Resource Group's properties, such as name, location, and tags.

9. **Code Review**
   - Conduct peer reviews to ensure code quality and adherence to best practices.
   - Address any feedback and make necessary improvements.

### Phase 4: Deployment

10. **Build Process Configuration**
    - Configure build scripts to include the E2E test as part of the build process.
    - Ensure the build process installs all necessary dependencies and sets up the environment correctly.

11. **Deployment Pipeline Integration**
    - Integrate the E2E test into the CI/CD pipeline.
    - Configure the pipeline to run the E2E test automatically on code changes or at scheduled intervals.

12. **Monitoring Setup**
    - Implement logging for test execution and Azure operations.
    - Set up monitoring to track test results and alert on failures or issues.

### Final Steps

13. **Documentation**
    - Update the project documentation to include setup instructions, usage guidelines, and troubleshooting tips.
    - Document the test cases and expected outcomes.

14. **Validation**
    - Ensure all acceptance criteria are met, including successful Resource Group creation, error handling, and CI/CD integration.
    - Validate that the test execution completes within the specified performance requirements.

15. **Deployment to Staging/Production**
    - Deploy the E2E test to the staging environment for final validation.
    - Once validated, deploy to the production environment.

By following this step-by-step strategy, we can ensure a robust and automated E2E test for Azure Resource Group creation, integrated seamlessly into the CI/CD pipeline.
