        # Project Plan: Add Email Notification System

## Overview
The goal of this project is to implement an email notification system that will send automated emails to users for specific actions such as account creation, password reset, and important updates. This feature will enhance user engagement and improve communication between the application and its users.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the repository is ready for development with the latest codebase.
   - [ ] Development environment: Configure the development environment with necessary tools and access.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Install necessary libraries for email handling (e.g., Nodemailer for Node.js, SMTP libraries).

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Implement account creation email: Develop functionality to send a welcome email upon user account creation.
   - [ ] Implement password reset email: Develop functionality to send a password reset email with a secure link.
   - [ ] Implement important updates email: Develop functionality to send emails for important updates or announcements.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write unit tests for each email notification function to ensure they work as expected.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Test the integration of the email system with the user management system.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct a thorough code review to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Ensure the build process includes the new email notification system.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Update the deployment pipeline to include steps for deploying the email system.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Implement monitoring for email delivery success and failure rates.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Account creation email is sent upon successful account registration - Expected: User receives a welcome email.
- **Test Case 2**: Password reset email is sent when a user requests a password reset - Expected: User receives an email with a reset link.
- **Test Case 3**: Important updates email is sent to all users when an update is published - Expected: All users receive the update email.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users receive a welcome email upon account creation.
- [ ] Users receive a password reset email with a secure link.
- [ ] Users receive emails for important updates.
- [ ] Emails are sent reliably and logged for auditing.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, SMTP server (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun), Database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
- **Performance**: Emails should be sent within 5 seconds of the triggering event.
- **Security**: Ensure secure handling of user data and email content; use TLS for email transmission.
- **Scalability**: The system should handle up to 10,000 emails per hour.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Email delivery failures due to SMTP server issues - Mitigation: Use a reliable email service provider with failover options.
- **Medium Risk**: Incorrect email content due to template errors - Mitigation: Implement thorough testing and template validation.
- **Low Risk**: Delays in email sending due to high load - Mitigation: Implement queuing and rate limiting.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 week - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 weeks - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 week - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 week - Deployment

This plan outlines the steps necessary to successfully implement an email notification system, ensuring that all aspects of software delivery are considered and executed efficiently.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the email notification system as outlined in the project plan, we will follow a structured approach. Here's a detailed step-by-step implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Ensure the repository is up-to-date with the latest codebase.
   - Create a new branch for the email notification feature to keep changes isolated.

2. **Development Environment Configuration**
   - Set up the development environment with Node.js and any necessary tools.
   - Ensure access to the SMTP server (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun) for sending emails.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Install Nodemailer or a similar library for handling email sending in Node.js.
   - Install any additional libraries required for SMTP communication and email templating.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Implement Account Creation Email**
   - Create a function to send a welcome email when a new user account is created.
   - Design an email template for the welcome message.
   - Integrate the email function with the user registration process.

2. **Implement Password Reset Email**
   - Develop a function to send a password reset email with a secure link.
   - Create a secure token generation mechanism for password reset links.
   - Design an email template for the password reset message.
   - Integrate the email function with the password reset request process.

3. **Implement Important Updates Email**
   - Create a function to send emails for important updates or announcements.
   - Design an email template for update notifications.
   - Integrate the email function with the system that triggers updates.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests for each email notification function to verify their functionality.
   - Test email content, recipient addresses, and error handling.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test the integration of the email system with the user management system.
   - Simulate user actions that trigger email notifications and verify email delivery.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a thorough code review to ensure adherence to coding standards and best practices.
   - Address any feedback or issues identified during the review.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Ensure the build process includes the new email notification system.
   - Verify that all dependencies are correctly included in the build.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Update the deployment pipeline to include steps for deploying the email system.
   - Test the deployment process in a staging environment before production.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement monitoring for email delivery success and failure rates.
   - Set up alerts for any issues with email delivery.

### Additional Considerations

- **Documentation**
  - Update the project documentation to include details about the email notification system.
  - Provide instructions for configuring and using the email system.

- **Security and Performance**
  - Ensure secure handling of user data and email content.
  - Use TLS for secure email transmission.
  - Implement queuing and rate limiting to handle high email volumes.

- **Risk Mitigation**
  - Use a reliable email service provider with failover options to mitigate delivery failures.
  - Validate email templates thoroughly to prevent content errors.

By following this strategy, we can ensure a successful implementation of the email notification system, meeting all the acceptance criteria and technical requirements outlined in the project plan.
