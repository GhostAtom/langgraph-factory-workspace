        # Project Plan: Add User Authentication System

## Overview
The goal of this project is to implement a comprehensive user authentication system that includes login, logout, and password reset functionalities. This feature will enhance the security and user experience of our application by allowing users to securely access their accounts and manage their credentials.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup & Preparation**
   - [ ] Repository setup: Ensure the repository is ready for new feature development.
   - [ ] Development environment: Configure local development environments for all team members.
   - [ ] Dependencies installation: Install necessary libraries and tools for authentication (e.g., bcrypt, JWT).

2. **Core Development**
   - [ ] Implement login functionality: Create endpoints and logic for user login, including session management.
   - [ ] Implement logout functionality: Develop endpoints to handle user logout and session termination.
   - [ ] Implement password reset functionality: Create a secure process for users to reset their passwords, including email verification.

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests: Write unit tests for all new functions and methods.
   - [ ] Integration tests: Develop integration tests to ensure all components of the authentication system work together.
   - [ ] Code review: Conduct thorough code reviews to ensure code quality and adherence to best practices.

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Build process: Ensure the build process includes the new authentication features.
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline: Update the CI/CD pipeline to deploy the authentication system to staging and production environments.
   - [ ] Monitoring setup: Implement monitoring to track authentication-related metrics and errors.

## Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: User can successfully log in with valid credentials - Expected: User is authenticated and redirected to the dashboard.
- **Test Case 2**: User receives an error message when logging in with invalid credentials - Expected: Error message is displayed, and user remains on the login page.
- **Test Case 3**: User can reset their password using the password reset feature - Expected: User receives a password reset email and can set a new password.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can log in and log out successfully.
- [ ] Users can reset their passwords securely.
- [ ] All authentication processes are secure and follow best practices.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JWT, bcrypt
- **Performance**: Authentication processes should complete within 200ms under normal load.
- **Security**: Implement HTTPS, secure password storage, and JWT for session management.
- **Scalability**: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in authentication - Mitigation: Conduct security audits and use established libraries.
- **Medium Risk**: Email delivery issues for password reset - Mitigation: Use a reliable email service provider and implement retry logic.
- **Low Risk**: User experience issues - Mitigation: Conduct user testing and gather feedback for improvements.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 week - Setup & Preparation
- **Phase 2**: 2 weeks - Core Development
- **Phase 3**: 1 week - Testing & Quality
- **Phase 4**: 1 week - Deployment and Monitoring Setup

This plan provides a structured approach to implementing a user authentication system, ensuring that all aspects of development, testing, and deployment are covered.
        
        Implementation Strategy:
        To implement the user authentication system as outlined in the project plan, we will follow a structured approach, breaking down the tasks into manageable steps. Here's a detailed implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Ensure the repository is initialized and ready for development.
   - Create a new branch for the authentication feature to keep changes isolated.

2. **Development Environment Configuration**
   - Set up Node.js and MongoDB on local machines.
   - Ensure all team members have access to the repository and necessary tools.

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Install necessary libraries:
     - `bcrypt` for password hashing.
     - `jsonwebtoken` (JWT) for token-based authentication.
     - `express` for handling HTTP requests.
     - `nodemailer` for sending emails (for password reset).
   - Update the `package.json` file with these dependencies.

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Implement Login Functionality**
   - Create a login endpoint in Express.
   - Validate user credentials against the database.
   - Use `bcrypt` to compare hashed passwords.
   - Generate a JWT token upon successful login.
   - Implement session management using JWT.

2. **Implement Logout Functionality**
   - Create a logout endpoint.
   - Invalidate the JWT token on the client-side (e.g., by removing it from local storage).

3. **Implement Password Reset Functionality**
   - Create an endpoint to initiate password reset.
   - Generate a secure token and send it via email using `nodemailer`.
   - Create an endpoint to handle password reset requests, validating the token and updating the password in the database.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests for each function using a testing framework like Mocha or Jest.
   - Ensure tests cover all edge cases and error handling.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Develop integration tests to verify the interaction between different components of the authentication system.
   - Test the complete login, logout, and password reset flows.

3. **Code Review**
   - Conduct code reviews with peers to ensure adherence to best practices and code quality.

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Ensure the build process includes all new authentication features.
   - Test the build locally to ensure it works as expected.

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Update the CI/CD pipeline to include steps for deploying the authentication system to staging and production environments.
   - Ensure rollback mechanisms are in place in case of deployment failures.

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement monitoring tools to track authentication-related metrics and errors.
   - Set up alerts for any unusual activity or errors in the authentication process.

### Additional Considerations

- **Security**
  - Ensure all endpoints are secured with HTTPS.
  - Regularly update dependencies to patch any security vulnerabilities.
  - Conduct security audits to identify and mitigate potential risks.

- **Documentation**
  - Update the project documentation to include details about the authentication system.
  - Provide clear instructions for setting up and using the authentication features.

- **User Testing**
  - Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback on the authentication process.
  - Make necessary adjustments based on user feedback to improve the user experience.

By following this step-by-step strategy, we can ensure a robust and secure implementation of the user authentication system, meeting all the acceptance criteria and technical requirements outlined in the project plan.
